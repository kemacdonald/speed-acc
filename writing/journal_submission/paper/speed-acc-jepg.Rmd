  During real-time language comprehension, listeners must link the incoming linguistic signal to the visual world despite noise in the input. Information gathered through visual fixations can facilitate understanding. But do listeners flexibly seek supportive visual information? Here, we propose that even young children can adapt their gaze and actively gather visual information that will support their language understanding. We present evidence using two case studies of eye movements during real-time language processing where the value of fixating on a social partner varies across different contexts. First, compared to children learning spoken English (n=80), young American Sign Language (ASL) learners (n=30) delayed gaze shifts away from a language source, were more accurate, and produced a higher proportion of language-driven shifts. This result suggests that ASL learners adapt to the trade-off between allocating attention to language or to referents, which both compete for processing via the same channel: vision. Second, English-speaking preschoolers (n=39) and adults (n=31) delayed the timing of gaze shifts away from a speaker's face while processing language in a noisy environment. This delay resulted in more accurate responses and a higher proportion of language-driven gaze shifts. These results suggest that young listeners can adapt their gaze to seek supportive visual information from their social partners during real-time language comprehension.

# Introduction 

Extracting meaning from language represents a formidable challenge for young learners. Consider that even in the simple case of understanding grounded, familiar language (e.g., "look at the ball"), listeners must quickly integrate linguistic and non-linguistic information from two continuous streams of input. Moreover, words occur within dynamic interactions where there is often insufficient information to figure out what is being said, and yet listeners must decide how best to respond. Even young children are capable of linking language to the world quite efficiently, shifting visual attention to a named object in a scene within hundreds of milliseconds upon hearing its name in controlled laboratory conditions [@spivey2002eye; @allopenna1998tracking; @tanenhaus1995integration; @fernald2006picking]. But how do children comprehend language when processing demands are higher and the input is noisy?

In interactive theories of language comprehension, listeners integrate noisy input from multiple sources of information to constrain the set of possible interpretations of an utterance [@mcclelland1986trace; @macdonald2006constraint]. Under this interactive account, listeners comprehend words by partially activating several candidates that are consistent with incoming perceptual information. As more information arrives, words that do not match the perceptual signal are no longer considered, and words that do match become more strongly activated until a single interpretation is reached (see @mcclelland2006there for a review). Critically, multiple sources of information -- the linguistic signal, visual world, and conceptual knowledge -- mutually influence one another to constrain the listener's interpretation of an utterance (e.g., the "McGurk effect" [@macdonald1978visual] and parsing syntactically ambiguous utterances [@tanenhaus1995integration]).

Thus, information gathered from the visual world can facilitate language comprehension. The incoming linguistic signal is transient, however, and rather than randomly fixate a scene, listeners might strategically deploy their fixations to informative locations that maximize successful comprehension. Consider a speaker who asks you to "Pass the salt" in a noisy restaurant where it is difficult to perceive what she is saying. Recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that children and adults handle this sort of noise in the signal by integrating what they perceive with their prior beliefs about the plausibility of a speaker's intended meaning [@gibson2013rational; @yurovsky2017preschoolers; @fourtassiword2018]. Here, we pursue the idea that the strategic gathering of visual information via looks to specific locations in the visual scene could support comprehension. Returning to the noisy restaurant example, the listener could facilitate understanding by looking at the objects on the table (e.g., the type of food the speaker is eating) or by looking at the speaker directly (e.g., reading her lips or the direction of her gaze), but not by allocating attention to other, perhaps quite salient, areas of the visual scene (e.g., a flashing light above the dinner table).

Another compelling case where strategic use of visual fixations becomes necessary is the comprehension of visual-manual languages such as American Sign Language (ASL). In ASL, fixations to the language source are highly informative because signers must process all linguistic information via the visual channel. Further, the decision to look away from a signer to the rest of the visual world could be risky because this behavior might reduce visual access to subsequent linguistic information, thus complicating the listener's decision to gather visual information that might constrain the meaning of a noisy utterance. Finally, ASL represents a compelling case where there is direct competition between allocating visual attention to the non-linguistic information -- gesture, eye gaze, and facial expressions -- that has been suggested to support spoken language comprehension. 

These examples highlight how we can characterize eye movements as an active decision-making process where listeners select fixations to gather language-relevant information. In the current work, we pursue this idea and propose that listeners are sensitive to the value of different fixation behaviors for the goal of grounded language understanding. We hypothesize that even young children can flexibly adapt the dynamics of their gaze to seek higher value visual information that supports comprehension.  Several research programs inspired this hypothesis, including work on language-driven shifts in visual attention [@allopenna1998tracking; @tanenhaus1995integration], goal-based accounts of eye movements in everyday tasks [@hayhoe2005eye], and language perception as a process of multisensory cue integration [@vigliocco2014language]. In the following sections, we briefly review each literature to motivate our explanation of information-seeking eye movements in grounded signed and spoken language comprehension.

## Vision-language interactions during language comprehension 

The study of eye movements during spoken language comprehension has provided insight into the interaction between concepts, language, and visual attention. The majority of this work has used the Visual World Paradigm (VWP) where listeners' eye movements are recorded at the millisecond timescale while processing language and looking at a set of objects (see `r knitcitations::citet(bib[["salverda2011goal"]])` for a review). Crucially, these analyses rely on the fact that listeners will initiate gaze shifts to named referents with only partial information, in contrast to waiting until the end of a cognitive process [@gold2000representation]. Thus, the time course of eye movements can provide a window onto how and when people integrate information to reach an interpretation of the incoming linguistic signal. 
    
A classic finding using the VWP shows that listeners will rapidly shift visual attention upon hearing the name of an object ("Pick up a beaker.") in the visual scene with a high proportion of shifts occurring soon after the target word begins  [@allopenna1998tracking]. Moreover, adults will look at a phonological onset-competitor ("beetle") early upon hearing the word "beaker," suggesting that they activate multiple interpretations and resolve ambiguity as the stimulus unfolds. Finally, empirical work shows that information from the visual world can constrain interpretation by activating listeners' conceptual representations before the arrival of the linguistic signal [@dahan2005looking; @yee2006eye]. These results fall out of predictions made by interactive models of speech perception where information from multiple sources is integrated rapidly to constrain language understanding [@mcclelland2006there; @macdonald2006constraint]. 

In addition to work in adult psycholinguistics, the VWP has been useful for studying developmental change in language comprehension skill in children. Researchers have adapted the task to measure the timing and accuracy of children's gaze shifts as they look at two familiar objects and listen to simple sentences naming one of the objects [@fernald2008looking; @venker2013individual]. Such research finds that children, like adults, shift gaze to named objects soon after the acoustic information is sufficient to enable referent identification. Further, individual differences in the speed and accuracy of eye movements predict vocabulary growth and later language and cognitive outcomes [@fernald2006picking; @marchman2008speed; @rigler2015slow].

In the current studies, we use the VWP to ask whether children strategically adapt their information seeking in response to the processing demands in their environments. This approach reflects a shift from construing eye movements in the VWP task as an index of the interaction between language and visual attention to an index of behaviors that gather information to support real-time language comprehension. This construal dovetails with a body of work on goal-based accounts of vision that start from the idea that eye movements are an active information-gathering process driven by perceivers' internal task goals [@hayhoe2005eye]. 

## Goal-based accounts of eye movements in everyday tasks

Under goal-based accounts of vision, people deploy gaze to reduce their uncertainty about the world and to maximize their expected future rewards concerning some goal. For example, @hayhoe2005eye review evidence that adults fixate on locations that are most helpful for their current task (e.g., looks to an upcoming obstacle when walking) as opposed to other aspects of a visual scene that might be more salient (e.g., a flashing light). Moreover, empirical work shows that adults gather task-specific information via different visual routines as they become useful for their goals. For example, @triesch2003you found that adults were less likely to collect and remember visual information about the size of an object when it was not relevant to the task of sorting and stacking the objects.

@hayhoe2005eye's review also highlights how perceivers learn to deploy efficient gaze patterns as they become more familiar with a task. They point out that visual routines develop over time, and it is only when a task becomes highly-practiced that people allocate fewer looks to less-relevant aspects of the scene. For example, @shinoda2001controls show that skilled drivers learn to spread visual attention more broadly at intersections to better detect stop signs. Other empirical work shows that the visual system rapidly learns to use temporal regularities in the environment to control the timing of eye movements to identify goal-relevant events [@hoppe2016learning]. Finally, the timing of eye movements in these tasks often occurs before an expected event, suggesting that gaze patterns reflect an interaction between people's expectations, the information available in the visual scene, and their task goals.

Recent theoretical work has argued for a stronger link between goal-based perspectives and the work on eye movements during language comprehension reviewed above. @salverda2011goal highlight the immediate relevance of visual information for language understanding, suggesting that listeners' goals should be a key predictor of fixation behaviors. Further, they point out that factors such as the difficulty of executing a real-world task should change decisions about where to look during comprehension. One example of applying a goal-based approach is @nelson2007probabilistic's study of gaze patterns during category learning. @nelson2007probabilistic modeled eye movements as a type of question-asking behavior and found that when participants became more familiar with novel concepts, their gaze patterns shifted from exploratory to efficient, suggesting that fixations changed as a function of goals during the task.

Pursuing this connection further, in our current studies, goal-based models of eye movements predict that gaze during language comprehension should adapt to the processing context. That is, listeners should change the timing and location of eye movements when a fixation area becomes more useful for understanding. This proposal, which we test, also connects with a growing body of research that explores the effects of multisensory (gesture, prosody, facial expression, and body movement) integration on language perception and comprehension. 

## Language perception as multisensory integration 

The final line of research that informs our studies is work exploring the process of language comprehension as multisensory integration. This research starts from the idea that language understanding does not just involve a single stream of linguistic information. Instead, face-to-face communication provides the listener with access to a set of multimodal cues that can shape language understanding (for a review, see Vigliocco, Perniss, and Vinson, 2014). For example, empirical work shows that when gesture and speech provide redundant cues to meaning, adults are faster to process the information and make fewer comprehension errors [@kelly2010two]. Moreover, developmental work shows that parents use visual cues such as gesture and eye gaze to structure language interactions with their children [@estigarribia2007getting]. And, from a young age, children also produce gestures such as reaches and points to share attention with others to achieve communicative goals [@liszkowski2012prelinguistic]. 

Most developmental accounts of early language acquisition begin from the ecological context of children grounding language within multimodal, social interactions [@clark2009first; @tomasello1986joint]. This literature has often focused on how children integrate social cues processed in a modality different from the linguistic signal (i.e., spoken words are auditory while a speaker's eye gaze or points are visual). The case of ASL, which we explore in this work, highlights how the process of integrating social cues with the linguistic signal is not necessarily cross-modal. When children comprehend ASL, both signs and social cues are visual and could compete for fixations. And yet we know little about how young ASL-learners deploy fixations to gather information about signs, social signals, or the contents of the visual world. 

Additional support for the role of multisensory processing in language comes from work on audiovisual speech perception. These studies show that visual information from a speaker's mouth can shape spoken language perception. In a review, @peelle2015prediction point out that mouth movements provide a clear indication of when someone has started to talk, which cues the listener to allocate additional attention to the speech signal. Further, a speaker's mouth movements convey information about the phonemes in the acoustic signal. For example, visual speech information distinguishes between consonants such as **/b/** vs. **/d/** and place of articulation can help a listener differentiate between words such as "cat" or "cap." Finally, classic empirical work shows benefits for audiovisual speech perception compared to auditory- or visual-only speech perception, especially in noisy listening contexts [@erber1969interaction].

In sum, work on multisensory processing shows that auditory and visual information interact to shape language perception. These results parallel the predictions of interactive models of language processing reviewed earlier [@mcclelland2006there; @macdonald2006constraint], and they suggest that visual information from a social partner is an essential input to children's language comprehension. Finally, this work highlights the importance of studying language understanding within face-to-face communication, where listeners can choose to look at their social partners to gather language-relevant information.

## The present studies

The current studies explore an information-seeking explanation of eye movements during grounded signed and spoken language comprehension. We propose that the timing of gaze shifts is related to the goal of gathering language-relevant visual information from a speaker balanced with fixating on the surrounding visual scene. We draw on models of eye movements as active decisions that collect information to achieve reliable interpretations of incoming language and test predictions of our account using two case studies: processing of signed vs. spoken language and processing spoken language in noisy vs. clear auditory environments. These cases, while superficially different, share a key feature: The interaction between the listener and their environment changes the value of fixating on the source of language to support comprehension. For example, in comparing ASL to spoken language, the value of looking to an interlocutor is higher since all of the language-relevant information is located at that point in the visual world; whereas a young child processing spoken language can fixate on other locations in the visual scene while still processing linguistic information via the auditory channel.

A secondary goal of this work was to test whether children and adults would show similar patterns of gaze adaptation in response to changes in the value of looking to a social partner for language understanding. Recent developmental work shows that, like adults, preschoolers will flexibly adjust how they interpret ambiguous sentences (e.g., "I had carrots and *bees* for dinner.") by integrating information about the reliability of the incoming perceptual information with their expectations about the speaker [@yurovsky2017preschoolers; @gibson2013rational]. While children's behavior paralleled adults, they relied more on top-down expectations about the speaker, perhaps because their perceptual representations were noisier. These developmental differences provide insight into how children succeed in understanding language despite having partial knowledge of word-object mappings.

The critical behavioral prediction is that children and adults will adapt the timing of their eye movements to facilitate word recognition. We hypothesized that as fixations to the source of language -- either a signer or a speaker -- provide higher value visual information, listeners should prioritize looking to their social partner. Concretely, in a noisy auditory environment, looks to a speaker's face should be more useful compared to the same behavior without background noise where it is easier to perceive the acoustic signal. In this case, we predict that listeners would be (a) slower to shift gaze away from the speaker's face, which in turn would lead to (b) more consistent shifts to named objects and (c) fewer early, nonlanguage-driven eye movements to the *rest* of the visual world. 



# Analytic approach

Before describing the empirical work, it is worth motivating our analytic approach. To quantify evidence for our predictions, for each experiment we present four analyses: (1) the time course of listeners' looking to each area of interest (AOI), (2) the Reaction Time (RT) and Accuracy of listeners' first shifts away from the signer/speaker, (3) an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) of first shifts, and (4) a Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) of first shifts. ^[All analysis code can be found in the online repository for this project: https://github.com/kemacdonald/speed-acc.]

First, we analyzed the time course of participants' looking to each AOI in the visual scene as the target sentence unfolded. Proportion looking reflects the mean proportion of trials on which participants fixated on the signer/speaker, the target image, or the distracter image at every 33-ms interval of the stimulus sentence. We tested condition differences in the proportion looking to the language source -- signer or speaker -- using a nonparametric cluster-based permutation analysis, which accounts for the issue of taking multiple comparisons across many time bins in the timecourse (see @maris2007nonparametric for details about the technique). This analysis tests the binary hypothesis of a difference between two time series and provides a high-level overview of how changes in the processing context modulated listeners' looking behavior. A higher proportion of looking to the language source across the trial would indicate listeners' prioritization of seeking information from the signer/speaker.

Next, we analyzed the RT and Accuracy of participants' initial gaze shifts away from the signer/speaker. RT corresponds to the latency of shifting gaze away from the central stimulus to either object measured from the onset of the target noun. We trimmed all reaction time distributions to between zero and two seconds and modeled RTs in log space. Accuracy corresponds to whether participants' first gaze shift landed on the target or the distracter object. This analysis of accuracy does not focus on the amount of time spent looking at the target vs. the distracter images – a measure typically used in analyses of the Visual World Paradigm. Moreover, while we use the term accuracy as a label for this dependent measure in our task, we do not want to claim that fixations to the distracter object are incorrect in a general sense since these behaviors could help listeners to encode the identity of objects in the scene better.

We chose to analyze first shifts because we think that they tend to reflect rapid decisions driven by accumulating information about the identity of the named object. This measure provides a window on to changes in the underlying dynamics of how listeners decide what kind of visual information to gather. If listeners generate slower but more accurate gaze shifts, this provides evidence that gathering more visual information from the signer/speaker led to more robust language comprehension.

We used the `rstanarm` [@gabry2016rstanarm] package to fit Bayesian mixed-effects regression models. The mixed-effects approach allowed us to model the nested structure of our data -- multiple trials for each participant and item, and a within-participants manipulation -- by including random intercepts for each participant and item, and a random slope for each item and noise condition. We used Bayesian estimation to quantify uncertainty in our point estimates, which we communicate using a 95% Highest Density Interval (HDI). The HDI provides a range of credible values given the data and model. Finally, to estimate age-related differences, we fit two types of models: (1) age group (adults vs. children) as a categorical predictor and (2) age as a continuous predictor (measured in days) within the child sample. In the main text, we report specific effects and contrasts of interest for our hypotheses, but, in the Appendix, we report the full model output for each analytic model in the paper.

Following the behavioral results, we present two model-based analyses. The goal of each model is to move beyond a description of the data and to map behavioral differences to underlying psychological processes. The EWMA models changes in the tendency to generate random gaze shifts as a function of when they occurred in the RT distribution [@vandekerckhove2007fitting]. For each RT, the model generates two values: a "control statistic" (CS, which captures the running average accuracy of first shifts) and an "upper control limit" (UCL, which captures the pre-defined limit of when we consider accuracy to be better than guessing). Here, the CS is an expectation of random shifting to either the target or the distracter image (nonlanguage-driven shifts), or a Bernoulli process with probability of success 0.5. As RTs get slower, we assume that participants have gathered more information and should become more accurate (i.e., language-driven), or a Bernoulli process with probability success > 0.5. Using this model, we can quantify the proportion of gaze shifts that were classified as language-driven as opposed to guessing. If listeners seek more visual information from the language source, then they should generate more language-driven shifts and fewer random responses.

Finally, following @vandekerckhove2007fitting, we selected the gaze shifts categorized as language-driven by the EWMA and fit a hierarchical Bayesian Drift-Diffusion Model (HDDM). The DDM is a cognitive model of decision making developed over the past forty years (Ratcliff  &  McKoon,  2008) that can help to quantify differences in the underlying decision process that lead to different patterns of observable behavior. The model assumes that people accumulate noisy evidence in favor of one alternative with a response generated when the evidence crosses a pre-defined decision threshold. We chose to implement a hierarchical Bayesian version of the DDM using the HDDM Python package [@wiecki2013hddm] since we had relatively few trials from child participants and recent simulation studies have shown that the HDDM approach was better than other fitting methods for small data sets [@ratcliff2015individual]. Here, we focus on two parameters of interest for our hypotheses: *boundary separation*, which indexes the amount of evidence gathered before generating a response (higher values suggest more cautious responding) and *drift rate*, which indexes the amount of evidence accumulated per unit time (higher values suggest more efficient processing). If listeners have a higher boundary separation estimate, this provides evidence that changes in information accumulation, as opposed to processing efficiency, led to higher accuracy rates.

```

In Experiment 1, we compared eye movements of children learning American Sign Language to children learning a spoken language using parallel real-time language comprehension tasks. In the task, children processed familiar sentences (e.g., "Where's the ball?") while looking at a simplified visual world with three fixation targets (a center stimulus that varied by condition, a target picture, and a distracter picture; see Figure\ \ref{fig:trio-stim}). The spoken language data are a reanalysis of three unpublished data sets, and the ASL data are reported in @macdonald2018real. Our primary question of interest is whether processing a sign language like ASL would increase the value of fixating on the language source and decrease the value of generating exploratory, nonlanguage-driven shifts even after the disambiguation point in the linguistic signal. If ASL learners are sensitive to the cost of shifting gaze away from a signer, then they would show evidence of prioritizing accuracy over and above the speed of shifting gaze to the named object.

## Methods

### Participants

trio_n <- df_trio %>% 
  select(Sub.Num, stimuli, age_code) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  mutate(`Center Stimulus` = stimuli) %>% 
  group_by(`Center Stimulus`, age_code) %>%

            Min = min(Months),
            Max = max(Months)) %>% 
  left_join(., filter(trio_n, age_code == "child")) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 1) %>% 
  select(-age_code)

trio_tab[, -1] <- printnum(trio_tab[, -1])

apa_table(
  trio_tab
  , caption = "Age distributions of children in Experiment 1. All ages are reported in months."
)
```

```{r trio get kid sample sizes}
kids_n <- df_trio %>% 
  filter(age_code == "child") %>% 
  select(Sub.Num, stimuli, Months, hearing_status_participant) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  group_by(stimuli, hearing_status_participant) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

spoken_eng_n <- kids_n %>% filter(stimuli != "ASL") %>% .$n %>%  sum()
asl_n <- kids_n %>% filter(stimuli == "ASL") %>% .$n %>%  sum()
hearing_n <- kids_n %>% filter(stimuli == "ASL", hearing_status_participant == "hearing") %>% .$n
deaf_n <- kids_n %>% filter(stimuli == "ASL", hearing_status_participant == "deaf") %>% .$n
```

Table 1 contains details about the age distributions of children in all four samples. 

*Spoken English samples.* Participants were `r spoken_eng_n` native, monolingual English-learning children divided across three samples with no reported history of developmental or language delay.

*ASL sample.* Participants were `r asl_n` native, monolingual ASL-learning children (`r deaf_n` deaf, `r hearing_n` hearing). All children, regardless of hearing status, were exposed to ASL from birth through extensive interaction with at least one caregiver fluent in ASL and were reported to experience at least 80% ASL in their daily lives. The ASL sample included a wider age range compared to the spoken English samples because this is a rare population.

There are differences between ASL and English question structures. However, all linguistic stimuli shared the same trial structure: language to attract participants' attention followed by a sentence containing a target noun.

*ASL linguistic stimuli.* We recorded two sets of ASL stimuli, using two valid ASL sentence structures for questions: 1) Sentence-initial wh-phrase: "HEY! WHERE [target noun]?" and 2) Sentence-final wh-phrase: "HEY! [target noun] WHERE?" Two female native ASL users recorded several tokens of each sentence in a child-directed register. Before each sentence, the signer produced a common attention-getting gesture. Mean sign length was `r ms_sign_len$m` ms, ranging from `r ms_sign_len$min_l` ms to `r ms_sign_len$max_l` ms.

*English linguistic stimuli.* All three tasks (Object, Bullseye, and Face) featured the same female speaker who used natural child-directed speech and said: "Look! Where's the (target word)?" The target words were: ball, banana, book, cookie, juice, and shoe. For the Face task, a female native English speaker was video-recorded as she looked straight ahead and said, "Look! Where's the (target word)?" Mean word length was `r ms_word_len$m[1]` ms, ranging from `r ms_word_len$min_l[1]` ms to `r ms_word_len$max_l[1]` ms.

*ASL and English visual stimuli.* The image set consisted of colorful digitized pictures of objects presented in fixed pairs with no phonological overlap (ASL task: cat—bird, car—book, bear—doll, ball—shoe; English tasks: book-shoe, juice-banana, cookie-ball). Side of target picture was counterbalanced across trials.

### Design and procedure

*Trial structure.* Children sat on their caregiver's lap and viewed the task on a screen while their gaze was recorded using a digital camcorder. On each trial, the child saw two images of familiar objects on the screen for two seconds before the center stimulus appeared. This time allowed the child to visually explore both images. Next, the target sentence -- which consisted of a carrier phrase, target noun, and question sign -- was presented, followed by two seconds without language to allow the child to respond to the signer's sentence. The trial structure of the Face, Object, and Bullseye tasks were highly similar: children were given two seconds to visually explore the objects prior to the appearance of the center stimulus, then processed a target sentence, and finally were given two seconds of silence to generate a response to the target noun. Participants saw 32 test trials with several filler trials interspersed to maintain interest.

*Coding.* Participants’ gaze patterns were videotaped and later coded frame-by-frame at 33-ms resolution by trained coders blind to target side.  On each trial, coders indicated whether the eyes were fixated on the central signer, one of the images, shifting between pictures, or away (off), yielding a high-resolution record of eye movements aligned with target noun onset. Prior to coding, all trials were pre-screened to exclude those few trials on which the participant was inattentive or there was external interference. To assess inter-coder reliability, 25% of the videos were re-coded. Agreement was scored at the level of individual frames of video and averaged 98% on these reliability assessments.

*Timecourse looking.* The first question of interest was how do young ASL and English learners distribute attention across the three fixation locations while processing language in real-time? Figure\ \ref{fig:speed-acc-trio-plot}A presents an overview of children's looking to each AOI for each processing context. This plot shows changes in the mean proportion of trials on which participants fixated the center stimulus, the target image, or the distracter image at every 33-ms interval of the stimulus sentence. At target-noun onset, children tended to look at the center stimulus. As the target noun unfolded, the mean proportion looking to the center decreased rapidly as participants shifted their gaze to the target or the distracter image. Proportion looking to the target increased sooner and reached a higher asymptote compared to proportion looking to the distracter for all four contexts. 

After looking to the target image, participants tended to shift their gaze back to the center, shown by the increase in proportion looking to the center around two seconds after target-noun onset. There were several qualitative differences in looking behavior across the different center stimulus types. First, both ASL- and English-learners who processed sentences from a video of speaker spent more time looking to the center as indicated by the shallower slope on their center-looking curves. Second, when the center stimulus was a static geometric object (Bullseye) or a static familiar object (Object), spoken language learners were more likely to look at the distracter image, especially early in the timecourse of the target noun as indicated by the parallel increase in target and distracter-looking curves in Figure\ \ref{fig:speed-acc-trio-plot}A. In contrast, spoken language learners in the Face context spent less time looking at the disracter, and ASL-learners rarely looked to the distracter image at any point in the trial. This pattern of behavior provides qualitative evidence that children adapated their gaze depending on language-relevant information available in the center stimulus loaction.

Based on a nonparametric cluster-based permutation analysis, the center-looking curve for the ASL learners was significantly different from all other conditions (all $p < .001$). Within the spoken language groups, children's looking to a speaker's face was different from looking to the Bullseye and the Familar object ($p < .001$). Finally, the Object and Bullseye center-looking curves were not different from one another, with no significant differences at any point in the timecourse. Next, we ask how these different processing contexts changed the timing and accuracy of children's initial decisions to shift away from the center stimulus.

*RT.* Figure\ \ref{fig:speed-acc-trio-plot}B shows the full RT data distribution. To quantify differences across the groups, we fit a Bayesian linear mixed-effects regression predicting first shift RT as a function of center stimulus type controlling for age: \texttt{Log(RT) $\sim$ center stimulus type + age +  (1 | subject) + (1 | item)}. ASL learners generated slower RTs compared to all of the spoken English samples ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$rt[2]` ms, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$hdi_lower[2]`, `r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$hdi_upper[2]`]). Moreover, ASL learners' shifts were slower compared directly to children processing spoken language in the Face condition ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$rt[1]` ms, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$hdi_lower[1]`, `r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$hdi_upper[1]`]). Finally, children in the Face context shifted gaze slower compared to participants in the Object and Bullseye contexts ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$rt[3]` ms, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$hdi_lower[3]`, `r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$hdi_upper[3]`]). 

*Accuracy.* Next, we compared the accuracy of first shifts across the different tasks (Figure\ \ref{fig:speed-acc-trio-plot}C) by fitting a mixed-effects logistic regression with the same specifications and contrasts as the RT model. We found that (a) ASL learners were more accurate compared to all of the spoken English samples ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$prop[2]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_lower[2]`, `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_upper[2]`]), (b) ASL learners were more accurate when directly compared to participants in the Face task ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$prop[1]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_lower[1]`, `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_upper[1]`]), (c) children learning spoken language were more accurate when processing language from dynamic video of a person speaking compared to the Object and Bullseye tasks ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$prop[4]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_lower[4]`, `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_upper[4]`]), and (d) English-learners' first shifts were no different from random responding in the Object ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$prop[5]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_lower[5]`, `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_upper[5]`]) and Bullseye ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$prop[3]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_lower[3]`, `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_upper[3]`]) contexts.

```

*EWMA.* Our third question of interest was how the tendency to generate random vs. language-driven (i.e, accurate) gaze shifts evolved as a function of reaction time across the different processing contexts. Figure\ \ref{fig:trio-model-plot}A shows changes in the control statistic (CS) and the upper control limit (UCL) as a function of RT. Each CS starts at chance performance and below the UCL. In the ASL and Face tasks, the CS value begins to increase with RTs around 0.7 seconds after noun onset and eventually crosses the UCL, indicating that responses > 0.7 sec were on average above chance levels. In contrast, the CS in the Object and Bullseye tasks never crossed the UCL, indicating that children's shifts were equally likely to land on the target or the distracter, regardless of when they were initiated. This result suggests that first shifts measured in the Bullseye/Object tasks were qualitatively different behaviors than those in the ASL and Face contexts. That is, these shifts are likely the result of a different generative process such as gathering more information about the referents in the visual world.

Next, we compared the EWMA model fits for participants in the ASL and Face processing contexts since these groups showed evidence of language-driven responding. We found that ASL learners generated fewer shifts when the CS was below the UCL compared to children learning spoken language ($\beta$ = `r ms_guess_trio_contrast$MAP[1]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_guess_trio_contrast$hdi_lower[1]`, `r ms_guess_trio_contrast$hdi_upper[1]`]). This result indicates that ASL-learners were more likely to have gathered sufficient information about the linguistic signal prior to shifting gaze away from the language source. We found some evidence that ASL learners started producing language-driven shifts earlier in the RT distribution as indicated by the point at which the CS crossed the UCL ($\beta$ = `r ms_cuts_trio_contrast$MAP[1]` sec, 95% HDI [`r ms_cuts_trio_contrast$hdi_lower[1]`, `r ms_cuts_trio_contrast$hdi_upper[1]`]), indicating that these children were less likely to generate early, random gaze shifts away from the signer.

  rename(Parameter = param_name) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(Mean, HDI_lower, HDI_upper), round, digits = 2)
```

*HDDM.* We fit a hierarchical Drift Diffusion Model using only the gaze shifts categorized as language-driven by the EWMA. This allowed us to ask what underlying decision processes are likely to account for the measured differences in First Shift Accuracy and RT. ^[We chose not to interpret the HDDM fits for the Bullseye or Face tasks since there was no suggestion of any non-guessing signal from the EWMA analysis.] ASL learners had a higher estimate for the boundary separation parameter compared to children processing spoken English from a speaker (ASL boundary = `r ms.hddm_trio$Mean[1]`, 95% HDI [`r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_lower[1]`, `r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_upper[1]`]; Face boundary = `r ms.hddm_trio$Mean[2]`, 95% HDI [`r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_lower[2]`, `r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_upper[2]`]), with no overlap in the HDIs (see Figure\ \ref{fig:trio-model-plot}C). This suggests that ASL learners' higher accuracy was driven by accumulating more evidence about the linguistic signal before generating an eye movement. We found high overlap for estimates of the drift rate parameter, indicating that both groups processed the linguistic information with similar efficiency (ASL drift = `r ms.hddm_trio$Mean[3]`, 95% HDI [`r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_lower[3]`, `r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_upper[3]`]; Face drift = `r ms.hddm_trio$Mean[4]`, 95% HDI [`r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_lower[4]`, `r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_upper[4]`]).

## Discussion

The behavioral and model-based analyses provide converging support that ASL learners were sensitive to the value of delaying eye movements away from the language source. Compared to spoken language learners, ASL learners prioritized accuracy over speed (HDDM), produced fewer nonlanguage-driven shifts away from the center stimulus (EWMA), and were more accurate with these gaze shifts (behavioral). Importantly, we did not see evidence in the HDDM model fits that these accuracy differences could be explained by differential efficiency in processing the linguistic information. Instead, the pattern of results suggests that ASL learners increased their decision threshold to gather more information before shifting gaze away from the signer and to a named object.

We hypothesized that prioritizing accuracy of gaze shifts when processing a visual-manual language is an adaptive response. That is, to map referential language to the visual world in ASL involves competition for visual attention. When ASL learners choose to shift their gaze away from a signer, they are leaving an area that provides a great deal of useful information. Further, unlike children learning spoken languages, ASL learners cannot gather more of the linguistic signal if their gaze is directed away from a signer. Thus, it seems reasonable that ASL learners would adapt the timing of their gaze shifts to gather additional information that increases certainty in their comprehension before seeking a named object.

These findings, however, were based on exploratory analyses, and our information-seeking explanation was developed to explain this pattern of results. There are several, potentially significant differences between the stimuli, apparatus, and populations that limit the strength of our interpretation and the generality of our account. We also cannot make causal conclusions because of the observational nature of research comparing children who are learning different languages. Thus, we designed Experiment 2 to address these concerns by constructing a well-controlled situation that created information-seeking demands that are analogous on some dimensions to the modality-based differences in Experiment 1.

# Experiment 2

In Experiment 2, we created a well-controlled experimental context where we could manipulate the information-seeking demands in ways that parallel some aspects of the differences between young ASL- and English-learners. ^[See https://osf.io/g8h9r/ for a pre-registration of the analysis plan.] We measured adults and children's eye movements during a real-time language comprehension task where participants processed familiar sentences (e.g., "Where's the ball?") while looking at a simplified visual world with three fixation targets. Using a within-participants design, we manipulated the signal-to-noise ratio of the auditory signal by convolving the acoustic input with brown noise (random noise with higher energy at lower frequencies). We chose to manipulate background noise because it allowed us to increase the value of looking to a speaker for language comprehension, and it could be used with both adults and children.

We predicted that processing speech in a noisy context would make participants less likely to shift before collecting sufficient information indexed by a lower proportion of shifts flagged as random/exploratory in the EWMA analysis. We also predicted a developmental difference: that children would produce a higher proportion of random shifts and accumulate information less efficiently compared to adults (indexed by lower estimates of drift and boundary separation in the DDM), and a developmental parallel: that children would also adapt gaze to gather additional visual information from the speaker in the noisier auditory environment.

### Stimuli 

```{r linguistic stimuli length}
d_word_lengths <- d_stim %>% 
  filter(!is.na(noun)) %>% 
  select(noun, carrier, noun_onset_sec:noun_offset_frames) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("noun_")), as.numeric) %>% 
  mutate(
    length_frames =  ( (noun_offset_sec * 33) + noun_offset_frames ) - ( (noun_onset_sec * 33) + (noun_onset_frames) ),
    length_ms = length_frames * 33
  ) 

ms_words_length <- d_word_lengths %>% 
  group_by(carrier, noun) %>% 
  summarise(m_length = mean(length_ms)) %>% 
  group_by(noun) %>% 
  summarise(m = mean(m_length) %>% round(digits = 2)) 
```

*Linguistic stimuli.* The video/audio stimuli were recorded in a sound-proof room and featured two female speakers who used natural child-directed speech and said one of two phrases: "Hey! Can you find the (target word)" or "Look! Where's the (target word). The target words were: ball, bunny, boat, bottle, cookie, juice, chicken, and shoe. The target words varied in length (shortest = `r min(ms_words_length$m)` ms, longest = `r max(ms_words_length$m)` ms) with an average length of `r mean(ms_words_length$m) %>% round(digits=2)` ms. 

*Noise manipulation*. To create the stimuli in the noise condition, we convolved each recording with Brown noise using the Audacity audio editor. The average signal-to-noise ratio (values greater than 0 dB indicate more signal than noise) in the noise condition was 2.87 dB compared to the clear condition, which was 35.05 dB. 

*Visual stimuli.* The image set consisted of colorful digitized pictures of objects presented in fixed pairs with no phonological overlap between the target and the distracter image (cookie-bottle, boat-juice, bunny-chicken, shoe-ball). The side of the target picture was counterbalanced across trials.

### Design and procedure

Participants viewed the task on a screen while their gaze was tracked using an SMI RED corneal-reflection eye-tracker mounted on an LCD monitor, sampling at 30 Hz. The eye-tracker was first calibrated for each participant using a 6-point calibration. On each trial, participants saw two images of familiar objects on the screen for two seconds before the center stimulus appeared. Next, they processed the target sentence -- which consisted of a carrier phrase, a target noun, and a question -- followed by two seconds without language to allow for a response. Child participants saw 32 trials (16 noise trials; 16 clear trials) with several filler trials interspersed to maintain interest. Adult participants saw 64 trials (32 noise; 32 clear). The noise manipulation was presented in a blocked design with the order of block counterbalanced across participants.

### Behavioral analyses

*Timecourse looking.* Figure\ \ref{fig:noise-acc-rt-plot}A presents an overview of looking to the speaker, target, and distracter images for the noisy and clear processing contexts from the start of the target noun. Similar to the results in Experiment 1, participants tended to fixate on the speaker at target-noun onset. As the target noun unfolded, the mean proportion looking to the center decreased rapidly as participants shifted their gaze to the objects. Proportion looking to the target increased sooner and reached a higher asymptote compared to proportion looking to the distracter for both processing contexts and age groups. After looking to the target image, participants tended to shift their gaze back to the speaker as shown by the increase in center looking curve around 1 second. 

There are several developmental differences to highlight. First, children tended to look more to the objects at noun onset, as indicated by the lower intercept of children's center-looking curves. Second, children's target looking curves reached a lower asymptote as compared to adults and they spent relatively more time fixating on the distracter image, whereas adults rarely looked at the unnamed object after 0.5 seconds in the timecourse of the trial. And third, children showed a stronger tendency to shift back to the speaker after looking to the named object.

Visual inspection of the center looking curves suggests a difference in looking behavior in the noisy processing context. Both children and adult's spent more time fixating on the speaker when the auditory signal was less reliable as indicated by the rightward shift of the center-looking curves in the noisy condition. A cluster-based permutation test confirmed that there was evidence of a significant difference in looking to the speaker between the Noisy and Clear conditions ($p < .05$). This pattern of behavior provides evidence that reducing the quality of the auditory signal increased looking to the speaker early in the timecourse of the target noun.

*RT.* Figure\ \ref{fig:noise-acc-rt-plot}B shows the full distribution of the estimated RT differences between each participants' performance in the noisy and clear contexts. Both children and adults were slower to identify the target in the noise condition (Children $M_{noise}$ = `r ms_rt_noise$m_rt[4]` ms; Adult $M_{noise}$ = `r ms_rt_noise$m_rt[3]` ms), as compared to the clear condition (Children $M_{clear}$ = `r ms_rt_noise$m_rt[2]` ms Adult $M_{clear}$ = `r ms_rt_noise$m_rt[1]` ms). RTs in the noise condition were `r ms_noise_con_rt$m_rt[1]` ms slower on average, with a 95% HDI ranging from `r ms_noise_con_rt$hdi_lower[1]` ms to `r ms_noise_con_rt$hdi_upper[1]` ms, and not including the null value of zero condition difference. Older children responded faster than younger children ($\beta_{age}$ = `r ms_noise_age_rt$m_rt`, [`r ms_noise_age_rt$hdi_lower`, `r ms_noise_age_rt$hdi_upper`]), with little evidence for an interaction between age and condition within the child sample. 

*Accuracy.* Next, we modeled adults and children's first shift accuracy using a mixed-effects logistic regression with the same specifications (Figure\ \ref{fig:noise-acc-rt-plot}C). Both groups were more accurate than a model of random responding with the null value of $0.5$ falling well outside the lower bound of the 95% HDI for each group mean. Adults were more accurate ($M_{adults} =$ `r ms_acc_noise$prop[1] * 100`%) than children ($M_{children} =$ `r ms_acc_noise$prop[2] * 100`%). Interestingly, both groups showed evidence of higher accuracy in the noise condition: children ($M_{noise}$ = `r ms_acc_noise$prop[4]* 100`%; $M_{clear}$ = `r ms_acc_noise$prop[2]* 100`%) and adults ($M_{noise}$ = `r ms_acc_noise$prop[3]* 100`%; $M_{clear}$ = `r ms_acc_noise$prop[1]* 100`%). Accuracy in the noise condition was on average `r ms_noise_con_acc$m_acc[1] * 100`%  higher, with a 95% HDI from `r ms_noise_con_acc$hdi_lower[1]* 100`% to `r ms_noise_con_acc$hdi_upper[1] * 100`%. Note that the null value of zero difference falls at the very edge of the HDI. But `r prob_diff0$prob[1] * 100`% of the credible values are greater than zero, providing evidence for comparable, if not higher, accuracy in the noise condition. Within the child sample, there was no evidence of a main effect of age or an interaction between age and noise condition.

### Model-based analyses

```{r noise-model-plots, fig.env='figure', fig.cap = "Results for the model-based analyses for Experiment 2. The plotting conventions are the same as Figure 3."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here(image_path, "fig6_noise_models.png"), dpi = 300)
```

**EWMA.** Figure\ \ref{fig:noise-model-plots}A shows the proportion of shifts that the model classified as random vs. language-driven for each age group and processing context. On average, `r ms_guess_noise_age$MAP[2] * 100`% (95% HDI: `r ms_guess_noise_age$hdi_lower[2] * 100`%, `r ms_guess_noise_age$hdi_upper[2] * 100`%) of children's shifts were categorized as language-driven, which was significantly fewer than adults, `r ms_guess_noise_age$MAP[1] * 100`% (95% HDI: `r ms_guess_noise_age$hdi_lower[1] * 100`%, `r ms_guess_noise_age$hdi_upper[1] * 100`%). Critically, processing speech in a noisy context caused both adults and children to generate a higher proportion of language-driven shifts (i.e., fewer random, exploratory shifts away from the speaker), with the 95% HDI excluding the null value of zero condition difference ($\beta_{noise}$ = `r ms_cond_diff_guessing_m$MAP[2] * 100`%, [`r ms_cond_diff_guessing_m$hdi_lower[2] * 100`%, `r ms_cond_diff_guessing_m$hdi_upper[2] * 100`%]). Within the child sample, older children generated fewer random, early shifts ($M_{age}$ = `r ms_ewma_age_kids$MAP`, [`r ms_ewma_age_kids$hdi_lower`, `r ms_ewma_age_kids$hdi_upper`]). There was no evidence of an interaction between age and condition. This pattern of results suggests that the noise condition caused participants to increase visual fixations to the language source, leading them to generate fewer exploratory, random shifts before they had accumulated sufficient information to respond accurately.

**HDDM.** Figure\ \ref{fig:noise-model-plots}B shows the full posterior distributions for the HDDM output. Children had lower estimates of drift rate (children $M_{drift}$ = `r hddm_table_age$MAP[4]`; adults $M_{drift}$ = `r hddm_table_age$MAP[3]`) and boundary separation (children $M_{boundary}$ = `r hddm_table_age$MAP[2]`; adults $M_{boundary}$ = `r hddm_table_age$MAP[1]`) as compared to adults, suggesting that children were less efficient and gathered less information. The noise manipulation selectively affected the boundary separation parameter, with higher estimates in the noise condition for both age groups ($\beta_{noise}$ = `r hddm_table_contrast$MAP[1]`, [`r hddm_table_contrast$HDI_lower[1]`, `r hddm_table_contrast$HDI_upper[1]`]). This result suggests that participants in the noise condition prioritized information accumulation over speed when generating an eye movement in response to the incoming language, and this increased decision threshold led to higher accuracy. Moreover, the high overlap in estimates of drift rate suggests that participants were able to integrate the visual and auditory signals such that they could achieve a level of processing efficiency comparable to the clear processing context.

The behavioral and model-based results provide evidence for our information-seeking explanation of eye movements during grounded language comprehension. Processing speech in noise caused both children and adults to look longer at their social partner, which in turn, resulted in a higher proportion of accurate gaze shifts to a named object. Moreover, we observed a  similar pattern of behavior in children and adults, with both groups producing more language-driven shifts (EWMA) and prioritized accuracy over speed (HDDM) in the more challenging noisy environment. 

Our analysis plan was preregistered, but there were some cases where we deviated or did not predict a particular result. We successfully predicted that the noise manipulation would cause listeners to gather more information by looking longer at the speaker's face (slower RTs) and that this behavior would lead listeners to produce a higher proportion of language-driven shifts as indexed by the EWMA analysis. We did not, however, predict that first shifts would be *more* accurate in the noisier context and that the noise manipulation would selectively affect the boundary separation parameter in the HDDM. Finally, based on time and resource constraints, we did not collect our planned sample size (42) for each age group (3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds) in the target age range; instead, we decided to use age as a continuous covariate and collected a single sample that included children across the entire age range.


# General Discussion

Language comprehension in grounded, social contexts provides children access to a rich set of multimodal cues that could support the linking of linguistic information to the world. But do children flexibly select what information to gather? In this work, we proposed that listeners adapt their gaze to seek visual information from their social partners when it was especially useful for language comprehension. We presented evidence for this explanation by measuring changes in how children chose to allocate visual attention across two diverse language processing contexts. In Experiment 1, we found that, compared to children learning spoken English, young ASL-learners delayed their gaze shifts away from a language source, were more accurate, and produced a higher proportion of language-driven eye movements. In Experiment 2, we showed that 3-5 year-olds and adults delayed the timing of gaze shifts away from a speaker's face while processing speech in a noisy auditory environment. This slower response resulted in fewer nonlanguage-driven eye movements and more accurate gaze shifts. 

These results synthesize ideas from several research programs, including work on language-driven visual attention [@tanenhaus1995integration], goal-based accounts of vision during everyday tasks [@hayhoe2005eye], and work on language perception as multisensory integration [@vigliocco2014language]. Our findings also parallel the results of several recent studies that measure the adaption of visual processes in response to different auditory experiences. First, @heimler2015finding compared Deaf and hearing adults' performance on an oculomotor singleton detection paradigm where participants made speeded eye-movements to a unique target embedded among distracters that varied in saliency. Deaf adults were slower to generate a gaze shift away from the center fixation and, as a result, they were less affected by high saliency distracters. Second, @mcmurray2017waiting found that individuals with cochlear implants, who are consistently processing degraded auditory input, are more likely to delay the process of lexical access as measured by slower gaze shifts to named referents and fewer incorrect gaze shifts to phonological onset competitors. @mcmurray2017waiting also found that they could replicate these changes in adults with typical hearing by using noise-vocoded speech stimuli that shared features with the output of a cochlear implant.

Our findings also connect to the literature investigating how experience with a visual-manual language may change basic cognitive processes (see @bavelier2006deaf for a review). The upshot of this work is that the effects of Deafness are dissociable from the effects of learning a signed language. Specifically, Deaf individuals show selective enhancement in peripheral visual attention as evidenced by higher sensitivity to peripheral distracters on spatial orienting tasks. In contrast, learning to sign results in several specific changes such as enhanced mental imagery [@emmorey1993visual], mental rotation [@emmorey1998mental], and face processing [@bettger1997enhanced]. The results of Experiment 1 suggest that ASL learners adapt the timing of when they disengage from a language source to increase their certainty before seeking named object. It is an open question as to whether ASL-learners' differential responding is best explained by a lack of access to auditory information or learning a visual-manual language.

Finally, our results dovetail with recent developmental work by @yurovsky2017preschoolers. In their study, preschoolers, like adults, were able to integrate top-down expectations about the kinds of things speakers are likely to talk about with bottom-up cues from auditory perception. @yurovsky2017preschoolers situated this finding within the framework of modeling language as a *noisy channel* where listeners combine expectations with perceptual data and weight each based on its reliability. In Experiment 2, we found a similar developmental parallel in language processing: that 3-5 year-olds, like adults, adapted their gaze patterns to seek additional visual information when the auditory signal became less reliable. This adaptation allowed listeners to generate comparable, if not more, accurate responses in the noisy context. 

In sum, the work reported here shows that young listeners can seek visual information to support language comprehension. These results fit well with the interactive models of language perception reviewed in the Introduction [@mcclelland2006there; @macdonald2006constraint]. These studies also highlight the value of integrating observational and experimental approaches. In Experiment 1, we compared language comprehension across populations of children who had very different language experiences (signed vs. spoken) to generate a new explanation of observed differences in children's gaze dynamics. We were able to better understand this observational result by designing a well-controlled, follow-up experiment that allowed us to make stronger claims about the generality of our hypothesis. 

## Limitations and future work

Our results provide evidence that young listeners can adapt their gaze patterns to the demands of different processing environments to seek visual information from social partners that support language comprehension. We cannot, however, make claims about how children's behavior in our task (the Visual World Paradigm: VWP) would generalize to their decisions about how to distribute attention within real-world learning environments. There is a growing body of research showing meaningful links between children's gaze behavior in the VWP and relevant outcome measures such as vocabulary development [@fernald2006picking; @marchman2008speed; @rigler2015slow]. Nonetheless, a valuable next step for our work would be to leverage tasks that move closer to the ecological context in which children process and learn language such as using head-mounted cameras and eye trackers that would allow measurement of where children choose to look during everyday interactions [@fausey2016faces; @franchak2011head].

This work has several other limitations. First, we chose to focus on a single decision about visual fixation to provide a window onto the dynamics of decision-making across different language processing contexts. But our analysis does not consider the rich information present in the gaze patterns that occur leading up to this decision. In our future work, we aim to measure how changes in the language environment might lead to shifts in the dynamics of gaze across a longer timescale. For example, perhaps listeners gather more information about the objects in the scene before the sentence in anticipation of allocating more attention to the speaker once they start to speak. 

Second, we chose one instantiation of a noisy processing context -- random background noise. But we think our findings should generalize to settings where other kinds of noise -- e.g., uncertainty over a speaker's reliability or when processing accented speech -- make gathering visual information from the speaker more useful for language understanding. Moreover, we used a simple visual world, with only three places to look, and simple linguistic stimuli. Thus it remains an open question how these results might scale up to more complex language interactions and visual environments. It could be that looks to a speaker become even more useful for disambiguating reference in complex visual environments. 

Third, we do not yet know what might be driving the population differences between children learning ASL and children learning spoken English found in Experiment 1. It could be that ASL-learners' massive experience dealing with competition for visual attention leads to changes in the deployment of eye movements during language comprehension. Or, it could be that the in-the-moment constraints of processing a visual language cause different fixation behaviors. This question could be addressed by studies that measure how quickly listeners adapt the dynamics of gaze when visual information becomes more useful. Another interesting approach would be to measure eye movements in hearing children learning both a signed and a spoken language (bimodal bilinguals). Our prior work found that hearing and Deaf native ASL learners show remarkably similar looking patterns over the time course of processing familiar signs [@macdonald2018real]. It would be interesting if hearing signers also prioritize accuracy over speed when comprehending their spoken language. This result would suggest that experience with a visual-manual language is changing a general response strategy, but if gaze dynamics looked different across language modalities within an individual, then this would favor an explanation based on the in-the-moment constraints of processing a visual-manual language in real-time.

Finally, our eye tracking paradigm removes an important component of successful communication: dynamic interaction between the speaker and listener. It is interesting to consider how speakers might adapt their behavior present the listener with useful visual information in challenging comprehension contexts. For example, in noisy environments, speakers will exaggerate mouth movements [@fitzpatrick2011effect] and increase the frequency of gestural cues such as head nodding [@munhall2004visual], and parents exaggerate mouth movements during infant-directed speech [@green2010lip]. Moreover, observational studies of parent-child interactions in signed languages show variability in how sensitive adult signers are to the competing demands on children's visual attention [@harris1997learning]. That is, some interactions contain many utterances that young signers miss because they are fixating on objects; whereas other interactions are marked by adaptations that accommodate the demands on visual attention by parents displacing signs onto the objects that are currently the focus of children's attention (similar to follow-in labeling effects Tomasello and Farrar, 1986). Thus it is an open question how interacting with a speaker that adapts to increase the availability and utility of visual information might change children's decisions about visual fixation.  

## Conclusion

In this paper, we presented an information-seeking explanation for the differences in the dynamics of eye movements during grounded signed vs. spoken language comprehension. We started from an interesting, observational result: that ASL learners, compared to English-learning children, generate slower but more accurate gaze shifts away from a language source and to a named referent. We then tested the generality and causal claims of this explanation by experimentally manipulating the value of seeking visual information for language comprehension. We found that young listeners can adapt the dynamics of their gaze to gather visual information when it is useful for language understanding. 

While we chose to start with the domain of familiar language processing, this approach could generalize to the acquisition context. Consider that early in language learning, children are acquiring novel word-object links while also learning about visual object categories. Both of these tasks produce different goals that should, in turn, modulate children's decisions about where to allocate visual attention -- e.g., seeking nonlinguistic cues to reference such as eye gaze and pointing become critical when you are unfamiliar with the information in the linguistic signal. More generally, this approach presents a way forward for explaining decisions about visual fixation during language comprehension and acquisition across a broader set of processing contexts and at different stages of development.
