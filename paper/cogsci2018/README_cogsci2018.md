-----------------

There are two key RMarkdown files in the paper repository for "Adults and preschoolers seek visual information to support language comprehension in noisy environments"

* The first file is: `speed-acc-cogsci2018-viz.Rmd`. It contains the R code for generating the behavioral results figure (Figure 2). The code pulls data and model summaries from the data directory and outputs a .png image file (e1_behav_results.png) to the "figs" directory. 

* The second file is: `Speed-acc-cogsci_2018.Rmd`. It contains the paper writeup along with the R code for generating plots of the model-based analyses.

All statisical models reported in the paper can be found here:
