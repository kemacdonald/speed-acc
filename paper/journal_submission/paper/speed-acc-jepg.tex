resulted in more more accurate responding. These results suggest that

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Extracting meaning from language represents a formidable challenge for
young learners. Consider that even in the simple case of understanding
grounded, familiar language (e.g., \enquote{look at the ball}),
listeners must integrate linguistic and non-linguistic information from
two continuous streams of input. Moreover, language unfolds within
dynamic interactions where there is often insufficient information to
figure out what is being said, and yet the listener must decide how best
to respond. Despite these challenges, even young children are capable of
linking language to the world quite efficiently, shifting visual
attention to a named object in a scene within hundreds of milliseconds
upon hearing it's name (Allopenna, Magnuson, \& Tanenhaus, 1998; Spivey,
Tanenhaus, Eberhard, \& Sedivy, 2002; Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowlton,
Eberhard, \& Sedivy, 1995). How do young listeners comprehend language
despite noisy input and limited processing capabilities?

One solution is for children to integrate multiple sources of
information to constrain the set of possible interpretations (MacDonald
\& Seidenberg, 2006; McClelland \& Elman, 1986). Under this more
interactive account, listeners comprehend words by partially activating
several candidates that are consistent with incoming perceptual
information. Then, as more information arrives, words that do not match
the perceptual signal are no longer considered, and words that do match
become more strongly activated until a single interpretation is reached
(see McClelland, Mirman, and Holt (2006) for a review). Critically,
information from multiple sources -- the linguistic signal, visual
world, and conceptual knowledge -- mutually influences one another to
influence the interpretation of an utterance. For example, if a
speaker's mouth movements suggest one sound while their acoustic output
indicates another, the interaction results in the listener perceiving a
third, intermediate sound (the \enquote{McGurk effect}) (MacDonald \&
McGurk, 1978). Other research in psycholinguistics shows that listeners
use information in the visual scene to help them parse syntactically
ambiguous utterances (Tanenhaus et al., 1995).

Thus, information gathered from the visual world can facilitate language
comprehension. The incoming linguistic signal, however, is ephemeral and
multiple fixation behaviors could be useful, meaning that listeners must
quickly decide how to direct their gaze to informative locations in the
environment. Consider a speaker who asks you to \enquote{Pass the salt}
in a noisy restaurant where it is it difficult to perceive what she is
saying. Recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that children and
adults can handle this sort of noisy signal by integrating what they
percieve with their prior belief about the plausbility of a speaker's
intended meaning (Fourtassi \& Frank, 2017; Gibson, Bergen, \&
Piantadosi, 2013; Yurovsky, Case, \& Frank, 2017). here, comprehension
could be supported by integrating information gathered via looks to the
objects in the scene (e.g., the type of food she is eating), or by looks
to the speaker (e.g., reading her lips or the direction of her gaze).

Another interesting case is comprehension of visual-manual language such
as American Sign Language (ASL). When processing ASL, fixations to
signers are highly informative because all of the linguistic information
is processed through the visual channel. Moreover, the decision to look
away from a signer to gather information about the rest of the visual
scene is potentially risky because this behavior could reduces visual
access to subsquent linguistic information. Finally, ASL is also an
interesting case where there is direct channel competition for
processing non-linguistic information -- i.e., gesture, eye gaze, and
facial expressions -- that is argued to faciliate spoken language
comprehension.

Togther, these examples highlight how eye movements can be cast an
active decision-making process where listeners aim to maximize the
amount of language-relevant information they gather over time. In the
current work, we pursue this idea and propose that listeners are
sensitive to the value of different fixation behaviors for the goal of
grounded language understanding. We hypothesize that even young children
can flexibly adapt the dynamics of their gaze to seek higher value
visual information that aids comprehension. This hypothesis is inspired
by ideas from several research programs, including work on
language-driven shifts in visual attention (Allopenna et al., 1998;
Tanenhaus et al., 1995), goal-based accounts of eye movements in
everyday tasks (Hayhoe \& Ballard, 2005), and language perception as a
process of multisensory cue integration (e.g., gestures, facial
expressions, mouth movements) (Vigliocco, Perniss, \& Vinson, 2014). In
the following sections, we briefly review each of these literatures to
motivate our explanation of information-seeking eye movements in
grounded signed and spoken language comprehension.

\hypertarget{vision-language-interactions-during-language-comprehension}{%
\subsection{Vision-Language interactions during language
comprehension}\label{vision-language-interactions-during-language-comprehension}}

The study of eye movements during spoken language comprehension has
provided insight into the interaction between concepts, language, and
visual attention. The majority of this work has used the Visual World
Paradigm (VWP) where listeners' eye movements are recorded at the
millisecond timescale while processing language and looking at a set of
objects (see Salverda, Brown, and Tanenhaus (2011) for a review).
Crucially, these analyses rely on the fact that listeners will initiate
gaze shifts to named referents with only partial information, in
contrast to waiting until the end of a cognitive process (Gold \&
Shadlen, 2000). Thus, the timecourse of eye movements can provide a
window onto how and when people integrate information to reach an
interpretation of the incoming linguistic signal.

A classic finding using the VWP shows that listeners will rapidly shift
visual attention upon hearing the name of an object (\enquote{Pick up a
beaker.}) in the visual scene with a high proportion of shifts occurring
soon after the target word begins (Allopenna et al., 1998). Moreover,
adults tended to look at phonological onset-competitor (a beetle) early
in the target noun, suggesting that they had activated multiple
interpretations and resolved ambiguity as the stimulus unfolded. These
behavioral results fall out of predictions made by a family of
interactive models of speech perception where information from multiple
sources is integrated to constrain language understanding (MacDonald \&
Seidenberg, 2006; McClelland et al., 2006).

The visual world can also constrain the set of plausible interpretations
of language (Dahan \& Tanenhaus, 2005; Yee \& Sedivy, 2006). For
example, Altmann and Kamide (2007) showed that people will allocate more
looks to an empty wine glass as compared to a full beer glass upon
hearing the past tense verb \enquote{has drunk.} They proposed that
anticipatory eye movements reflect the ability of the visual information
in a scene to activate listeners' conceptual representations prior to
the arrival of the linguistic signal (see also Huettig and Altmann,
2005).

In addition to work on adult psycholinguistics, the VWP has been useful
for studying developmental change in language comprehension skill in
children. Researchers have adapted the task to measure the timing and
accuracy of children's gaze shifts as they look at two familiar objects
and listen to simple sentences naming one of the objects (Fernald,
Zangl, Portillo, \& Marchman, 2008; Venker, Eernisse, Saffran, \&
Weismer, 2013). Such research finds that children, like adults, shift
gaze to named objects occur soon after the auditory information is
sufficient to enable referent identification. Moreover, individual
differences in the speed and accuracy of eye movements predict
vocabulary growth and later language and cognitive outcomes (Fernald,
Perfors, \& Marchman, 2006; Marchman \& Fernald, 2008; Rigler et al.,
2015).

\hypertarget{goal-based-accounts-of-eye-movements-in-everyday-tasks}{%
\subsection{Goal-based accounts of eye movements in everyday
tasks}\label{goal-based-accounts-of-eye-movements-in-everyday-tasks}}

The majority of the work on language-driven visual attention has used
eye movements as an index of the underlying interaction between
linguistic, visual, and conceptual information. This approach reflects a
somewhat passive construal of how listeners might allocate visual
attention during language comprehension. A parallel body of work on
goal-based accounts of vision starts from the idea that eye movements
reflect an active information-gathering process during which visual
fixations are driven by task goals (Hayhoe \& Ballard, 2005).

Under these accounts, perceivers allocate visual attention to reduce
uncertainty about the world and to maximize their expected future
rewards with respect to some goal. For example, Hayhoe and Ballard
(2005) review evidence that adults fixate on locations that are most
helpful for their current task (e.g., looks to an upcoming obstacle when
walking) as opposed to other aspects of a visual scene that might be
more salient (a flashing light). Moreover, other empirical work shows
that adults gather task-specific information via different visual
routines as they become useful for their goals. For example, Triesch,
Ballard, Hayhoe, and Sullivan (2003) found that adults were less likely
to gather and store visual information about the size of an object when
it was not relevant to the task of sorting and stacking the objects.

Hayhoe and Ballard (2005)'s review also highlights how perceivers learn
to deploy efficient gaze patterns over the course of becoming more
familiar with a task. They point out that visual routines are developed
over time, and it is only when a task becomes highly-practiced that
people allocate fewer looks to less-relevant aspects of the scene. For
example, Shinoda, Hayhoe, and Shrivastava (2001) show that skilled
drivers learn to spread visual attention more broadly at intersections
to better detect stop signs. Other empirical work shows that the visual
system rapidly learns to use temporal regularities in the environment to
control the timing of eye movements to detect goal-relevant events
(Hoppe \& Rothkopf, 2016). Finally, the timing of eye movements in these
tasks often occur before an expected event, suggesting that gaze
patterns reflect an interaction between people's expectations, the
information available in the visual scene, and their task goals.

Connecting this body of evidence with the research on visual language
processing reviewed above, recent theoretical work has argued for a
stronger link between these goal-based perspectives and work on eye
movements during language comprehension. Salverda et al. (2011)
highlight the immediate relevance of visual information with respect to
the goal of language understanding, suggesting that listeners' goals
should be a key predictor of fixation behaviors. Moreover, they point
out that factors such as the difficulty of executing a real world task
should change decisions about where to look during comprehension. One
example of starting from a goal-based approach comes from Nelson and
Cottrell (2007)'s study of gaze patterns during category learning.
Nelson and Cottrell (2007) modeled eye movements as a type of
question-asking behavior and showed that as participants became more
familiar with novel concepts, their gaze patterns shifted from
exploratory to efficient, suggesting that fixations changed as a
function of learning goals during the task.

Pursuing this connection further, in our current studies, goal-based
models of eye movements predict that gaze during language comprehension
should adapt to the processing context. That is, listeners should change
the timing and location of eye movements when a fixation area become
more useful for comprehension. This proposal, which we test, dovetails
with a growing body of research that explores the effects of
multisensory (gesture, prosody, facial expression and body movement)
integration on language perception and comprehension.

\hypertarget{language-perception-as-multisensory-integration}{%
\subsection{Language perception as multisensory
integration}\label{language-perception-as-multisensory-integration}}

The final line of research that informs our studies is work exploring
the process of language comprehension as multisenory integration. This
research starts from the idea that language understanding does not just
involve a single stream of linguistic information. Instead, face-to-face
communication provides the listener with access to a set of multimodal
cues that can shape language understanding (for a review, see Vigliocco,
Perniss, and Vinson, 2014). For example, empirical work shows that when
gesture and speech provide redundant cues to meaning, adults are faster
to process the information and make fewer comprehension errors (Kelly,
Ã–zyÃ¼rek, \& Maris, 2010). Moreover, developmental work shows that
parents use visual cues such as gesture and eye gaze to structure
language interactions with their children (Estigarribia \& Clark, 2007).
And, from a young age, children also produce gestures such as reaches
and points to share attention with others to achieve communicative goals
(Liszkowski, Brown, Callaghan, Takada, \& De Vos, 2012).

In fact, most developmental accounts of early language acquisition begin
from the ecological context of children grounding language within
multimodal, social interations. This literature has often focused on how
children integrate social cues to meaning that occur in a different
modality (i.e., eye gaze or pointing processed via vision) than the
incoming language (i.e., words processed via audition). The case of ASL,
which we explore in this work, highlights how the process of integrating
social cues with the linguistic signal is not necessarily cross-modal.
When children process ASL, both the signs and social cues to meaning can
compete for processing via the visual channel. And yet we know little
about how children learning sign choose to deploy their eye movements to
gather information about signs, social cues to meaning, or the rest of
the contents of the visual world.

Additional support for the role of multisensory processing in language
comes from work on audiovisual speech perception. These studies show
that spoken language perception can be shaped by visual information
coming from a speaker's mouth. In a review, Peelle and Sommers (2015)
point out that mouth movements provide a clear indication of when
someone has started to speak, which cues the listener to allocate
additional attention to the speech signal. Moreover, a speaker's mouth
movements convey information about the phonemes in the acoustic signal.
For example, visual speech information distinguishes between consonants
such as \textbf{/b/} vs. \textbf{/d/} and place of articulation can help
a listener differentiate between words such as \enquote{cat} or
\enquote{cap.} Finally, classic empirical work shows benefits for
audiovisual speech perception compared to auditory- or visual-only
speech perception, especially in noisy listening contexts (Erber, 1969).

In sum, the work on multisensory processing shows that both auditory and
visual information interact to shape language perception. These results
parallel the claims of the interactive models of language processing
reviewed earlier and suggest that visual information should be
considered as an input to language comprehension (MacDonald \&
Seidenberg, 2006; McClelland et al., 2006). Finally, this work
highlights the value of studying language comprehension during
face-to-face communication, where listeners can choose to look at their
social partners to gather language-releveant visual information.

\hypertarget{the-present-studies}{%
\subsection{The present studies}\label{the-present-studies}}

The studies reported here explore language processing as a multimodal,
goal-based, and social phenomenon. We propose an information-seeking
explanation of eye movements during grounded signed and spoken language
comprehension: The timing of gaze shifts is related to the goal of
gathering language-relevant visual information from a speaker balanced
with fixating on the surrounding visual scene. We draw on models of eye
movements as active decisions that gather information to achieve
reliable interpretations of incoming language and test predictions of
our account using two case studies: processing of signed vs.~spoken
language and processing spoken language in noisy vs.~clear auditory
environments. These cases are superficially different but share a key
feature: The interaction between the listener and their environment
changes the value of fixating on the source of language to support
comprehension. For example, in comparing ASL to spoken language, the
value of looking to your interloctuor is higher since all of the
language-relevant information is located at that point in the visual
world; whereas a young child processing spoken language can fixate on
other locations in the visual scene while still processing linguistic
information via the auditory channel.

A secondary goal of this work was to test whether children and adults
would show similar patterns of gaze adaptation in response to changes in
the value of looking to a social partner for language understanding.
Recent developmental work shows that, like adults, preschoolers will
flexibly adjust how they interpret ambiguous sentences (e.g., \enquote{I
had carrots and \emph{bees} for dinner.}) by integrating information
about the reliability of the incoming perceptual information with their
expectations about the speaker (Gibson et al., 2013; Yurovsky et al.,
2017). While children's behavior paralleled adults, they relied more on
top-down expectations about the speaker, perhaps because their
perceptual representations were noisier. These developmental differences
provide insight into how children succeed in understanding language
despite having partial knowledge of word-object mappings.

The structure of the paper is as follows. First, we describe and
motivate our analytic approach. Then, we present a comparison of the
timing and accuracy of children's eye movements while they processed
signed vs.~spoken language. Finally, we compare both children and
adults' gaze patterns as they processed speech in either noisy vs.~clear
auditory environments.

The key behavioral prediction is that children and adults will adapt the
timing of their eye movements to facilitate word recognition. We
hypothesized that as fixations to the source of language -- either a
signer or a speaker -- provide higher value visual information,
listeners should prioritize looking to their social partner. For
example, in the case of a noisy vs.~clear environment, looks to a
speaker's face could be more useful for understanding compared to the
same behavior but in a clear environment where it is easier to process
the auditory signal. In this case, we predict that listeners would be
(a) slower to shift gaze away from that location, which in turn would
lead to (b) more consistent shifts to named objects and (c) fewer early,
nonlanguage-driven eye movements to the \emph{rest} of the visual world.

\hypertarget{analytic-approach}{%
\section{Analytic approach}\label{analytic-approach}}

Before describing the studies, it is worth motivating our analytic
approach. To quantify evidence for our predictions, we use four
analyses: (1) the timecourse of listeners' looking to each area of
interest (AOI), (2) reaction time (RT) and accuracy of listeners' first
shifts away from the signer/speaker, (3) an Exponentially Weighted
Moving Average (EWMA) of first shift accuracy, and (4) a Drift Diffusion
Model (DDM) of first shifts. All analysis code can be found in the
online repository for this project:
\url{https://github.com/kemacdonald/speed-acc}.

For each experiment, we first present an analysis of the timecourse of
looking to each AOI in the visual scene as the target sentence unfolds.
Proportion looking reflects the mean proportion of trials on which
participants fixated on the signer/speaker, the target image, or the
distracter image at every 33-ms interval of the stimulus sentence. Next,
we analyze RT and accuracy of participants' first gaze shifts away from
the signer/speaker. RT corresponds to the latency of shifting gaze away
from the central stimulus to either object measured from the onset of
the target noun.\footnote{All reaction time distributions were trimmed
  to between zero and two seconds and RTs were modeled in log space.}
Accuracy corresponds to whether participants' first gaze shift landed on
the target or the distracter object. It is important to note that this
analysis of accuracy does not focus on the amount of time spent looking
at the target vs.~the distracter image -- a measure typically used in
analyses of the Visual World Paradigm. These shifts reflect rapid
decisions driven by accumulating information about the identity of the
named object and thus provide a window onto changes in the underlying
dynamics of how listeners integrate linguistic and visual information.

We used the \texttt{rstanarm} (Gabry \& Goodrich, 2016) package to fit
Bayesian mixed-effects regression models. The mixed-effects approach
allowed us to model the nested structure of our data -- multiple trials
for each participant and item, and a within-participants manipulation --
by including random intercepts for each participant and item, and a
random slope for each item and noise condition. We used Bayesian
estimation to quantify uncertainty in our point estimates, which we
communicate using a 95\% Highest Density Interval (HDI). The HDI
provides a range of credible values given the data and model. Finally,
to estimate age-related differences, we fit two types of models: (1) age
group (adults vs.~children) as a categorical predictor and (2) age as a
continuous predictor (measured in days) within the child sample.

Following the behavioral analyses, we present two model-based
approaches. The goal of these models is to move beyond a description of
the data and map behavioral differences in eye movements to underlying
psychological variables. The EWMA models changes in the tendency to
generate random gaze shifts as a function of RT (Vandekerckhove \&
Tuerlinckx, 2007). For each RT, the model generates two values: a
\enquote{control statistic} (CS, which captures the running average
accuracy of first shifts) and an \enquote{upper control limit} (UCL,
which captures the pre-defined limit of when accuracy would be
categorized as better than guessing). Here, the CS is an expectation of
random shifting to either the target or the distracter image
(nonlanguage-driven shifts), or a Bernoulli process with probability of
success 0.5. As RTs get slower, we assume that participants have
gathered more information and should become more accurate (i.e.,
language-driven), or a Bernoulli process with probability success
\textgreater{} 0.5. Using this model, we can quantify the proportion of
gaze shifts that were language-driven as opposed to guessing.

Finally, following Vandekerckhove and Tuerlinckx (2007), we selected
shifts categorized as language-driven by the EWMA and fit a hierarchical
Bayesian Drift-Diffusion Model (HDDM). The DDM is a cognitive model of
decision making developed over the past forty years (Ratcliff \& McKoon,
2008) that can help to quantify differences in the underlying decision
process that lead to different patterns of behavior. The model assumes
that people accumulate noisy evidence in favor of one alternative with a
response generated when the evidence crosses a pre-defined decision
threshold. We chose to implement a hierarchical Bayesian version of the
DDM using the HDDM Python package (Wiecki, Sofer, \& Frank, 2013) since
we had relatively few trials from child participants and recent
simulation studies have shown that the HDDM approach was better than
other fitting methods for small data sets (Ratcliff \& Childers, 2015).
Here, we focus on two parameters of interest for our hypotheses:
\emph{boundary separation}, which indexes the amount of evidence
gathered before generating a response (higher values suggest more
cautious responding) and \emph{drift rate}, which indexes the amount of
evidence accumulated per unit time (higher values suggest more efficient
processing).

\hypertarget{experiment-1}{%
\section{Experiment 1}\label{experiment-1}}

Experiment 1 provides an initial test of our information seeking
account. We compared eye movements of children learning American Sign
Language to children learning a spoken language using parallel real-time
language comprehension tasks where children processed familiar sentences
(e.g., \enquote{Where's the ball?}) while looking at a simplified visual
world with three fixation targets (a center stimulus that varied by
condition, a target picture, and a distracter picture; see
Figure~\ref{fig:trio-stim}). The spoken language data are a reanalysis
of three unpublished data sets, and the ASL data are reported in
MacDonald, LaMarr, Corina, Marchman, and Fernald (2018). Our primary
question of interest is whether processing a sign language like ASL
would increase the value of fixating on the language source and decrease
the value of generating exploratory, nonlanguage-driven shifts even
after the disambiguation point in the linguistic signal. If ASL learners
are sensitive to the cost of shifting gaze away from a signer, then they
would show evidence of prioritizing accuracy over and above speed of
shifting gaze to the named object.

\end{figure}

There are differences between ASL and English question structures.
However, all linguistic stimuli shared the same trial structure:
language to attract participants' attention followed by a sentence
containing a target noun.

\emph{ASL linguistic stimuli.} We recorded two sets of ASL stimuli,
using two valid ASL sentence structures for questions: 1)
Sentence-initial wh-phrase: \enquote{HEY! WHERE {[}target noun{]}?} and
2) Sentence-final wh-phrase: \enquote{HEY! {[}target noun{]} WHERE?} Two
female native ASL users recorded several tokens of each sentence in a
child-directed register. Before each sentence, the signer produced a
common attention-getting gesture. Mean sign length was 1254 ms, ranging
from 693 ms to 1980 ms

\emph{English linguistic stimuli.} All three tasks (Object, Bullseye,
and Face) featured the same female speaker who used natural
child-directed speech and said: \enquote{Look! Where's the (target
word)?} The target words were: ball, banana, book, cookie, juice, and
shoe. For the Face task, a female native English speaker was
video-recorded as she looked straight ahead and said, \enquote{Look!
Where's the (target word)?} Mean word length was 0.80 ms, ranging from
0.60 ms to 0.90 ms.

\emph{ASL and English visual stimuli.} The image set consisted of
colorful digitized pictures of objects presented in fixed pairs with no
phonological overlap (ASL task: cat---bird, car---book, bear---doll,
ball---shoe; English tasks: book-shoe, juice-banana, cookie-ball). Side
of target picture was counterbalanced across trials.

\emph{Trial structure.} On each trial, the child saw two images of
familiar objects on the screen for two seconds before the center
stimulus appeared. This time allowed the child to visually explore both
images. Next, the target sentence -- which consisted of a carrier
phrase, target noun, and question sign -- was presented, followed by two
seconds without language to allow the child to respond to the signer's
sentence. The trial structure of the Face, Object, and Bullseye tasks
were highly similar: children were given two seconds to visually explore
the objects prior to the appearance of the center stimulus, then
processed a target sentence, and finally were given two seconds of
silence to generate a response to the target noun.

\hypertarget{design-and-procedure}{%
\subsubsection{Design and procedure}\label{design-and-procedure}}

Children sat on their caregiver's lap and viewed the task on a screen
while their gaze was recorded using a digital camcorder. On each trial,
children saw two images of familiar objects on the screen for two
seconds before the center stimulus appeared (see
Figure~\ref{fig:trio-stim})). Then they processed the target sentence --
which consisted of a carrier phrase, a target noun, and a question --
followed by two seconds without language to allow for a response.
Participants saw 32 test trials with several filler trials interspersed
to maintain interest.

\emph{Coding.} Participants' gaze patterns were coded (33-ms resolution)
as being fixated on either the center stimulus, one of the images,
shifting between pictures, or away. To assess inter-coder reliability,
25\% of the videos were re-coded. Agreement was scored at the level of
individual frames of video and averaged 98\% on these reliability
assessments.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{behavioral-analyses}{%
\subsubsection{Behavioral analyses}\label{behavioral-analyses}}

\emph{Timecourse looking.} The first question of interest was how do
young ASL and English learners distribute attention across the three
fixation locations while processing language in real-time?
Figure~\ref{fig:speed-acc-trio-plot}A presents an overview of children's
looking to the center, target, and distracter images for each processing
context. This plot shows changes in the mean proportion of trials on
which participants fixated the signer, the target image, or the
distracter image at every 33-ms interval of the stimulus sentence. At
target-noun onset, children tended to look at the center. As the target
noun unfolded, the mean proportion looking to the center decreased
rapidly as participants shifted their gaze to the target or the
distracter image. Proportion looking to the target increased sooner and
reached a higher asymptote, compared to proportion looking to the
distracter, for all four processing contexts.

After looking to the target image, participants tended to shift their
gaze back to the center, shown by the increase in proportion looking to
the center around two seconds after target-noun onset. There were
several qualitative differences in looking behavior across the different
center stimulus types. First, both ASL- and English-learners who
processed sentences from a video of speaker spent more time looking to
the center as indicated by the shallower slope on their center-looking
curves. Second, when the center stimulus was a static geometric object
(Bullseye) or a static familiar object (Object), spoken language
learners were more likely to look at the distracter image, especially
early in the timecourse of the target noun as indicated by the parallel
increase in target and distracter-looking curves in
Figure~\ref{fig:speed-acc-trio-plot}A. In contrast, spoken language
learners in the Face context spent less time looking at the disracter,
and ASL-learners rarely looked to the distracter image at any point in
the trial. This pattern of behavior provides qualitative evidence that
children adapated their gaze depending on information available in the
visual world and the modality of their language.

We tested differences in proportion looking to the center using a
nonparametric cluster-based permutation analysis, which accounts for the
issue of taking multiple comparisons across many time bins in the
timecourse (Maris \& Oostenveld, 2007). The center-looking curve for the
ASL learners was significantly different from all other conditions (all
\(p < .001\)). Within the spoken language groups, children's looking to
a speaker's face was different from looking to the Bullseye and the
Familar object (\(p < .001\)). Finally, the Object and Bullseye
center-looking curves were not different from one another, with no
significant differences at any point in the timecourse. Next, we ask how
these different processing contexts changed the timing and accuracy of
children's initial decisions to shift away from the center stimulus.

\emph{RT.} Figure~\ref{fig:speed-acc-trio-plot}B shows the full RT data
distribution. To quantify differences across the groups, we fit a
Bayesian linear mixed-effects regression predicting first shift RT as a
function of center stimulus type controlling for age:
\texttt{Log(RT) $\sim$ center stimulus type + age +  (1 | subject) + (1 | item)}.
ASL learners generated slower RTs compared to all of the spoken English
samples (\(\beta\) = 595.20 ms, 95\% HDI {[}444.60 ms, 760.80 ms{]}).
Moreover, ASL learners' shifts were slower compared directly to children
processing spoken language in the Face condition (\(\beta\) = 323.10 ms,
95\% HDI {[}132.30 ms, 522.60 ms{]}). Finally, children in the Face
context shifted gaze slower compared to participants in the Object and
Bullseye contexts (\(\beta\) = 408.20 ms, 95\% HDI {[}286.60 ms, 546.20
ms{]}).

\emph{Accuracy.} Next, we compared the accuracy of first shifts across
the different tasks (Figure~\ref{fig:speed-acc-trio-plot}C) by fitting a
mixed-effects logistic regression with the same specifications and
contrasts as the RT model. We found that (a) ASL learners were more
accurate compared to all of the spoken English samples (\(\beta\) =
0.23, 95\% HDI {[}0.17{]}, 0.29), (b) ASL learners were more accurate
when directly compared to participants in the Face task (\(\beta\) =
0.13, 95\% HDI {[}0.04, 0.23{]}), (c) children learning spoken language
were more accurate when processing language from dynamic video of a
person speaking compared to the Object and Bullseye tasks (\(\beta\) =
0.16, 95\% HDI {[}0.07, 0.24{]}), and (d) English-learners' first shifts
were no different from random responding in the Object (\(\beta\) =
-0.04, 95\% HDI {[}-0.13, 0.03{]}) and Bullseye (\(\beta\) = -0.02, 95\%
HDI {[}-0.12, 0.08{]}) contexts.

\end{figure}

\emph{EWMA.} Our third question of interest was how the tendency to
generate random vs.~language-driven (i.e, accurate) gaze shifts evolved
as a function of reaction time across the different processing contexts.
Figure~\ref{fig:trio-model-plot}A shows changes in the control statistic
(CS, weighted moving average) and the upper control limit (UCL, upper
threshold on guessing) as a function of RT. Each CS starts at chance
performance and below the UCL. In the ASL and Face tasks, the CS value
begins to increase with RTs around 0.7 seconds after noun onset and
eventually crosses the UCL, indicating that responses \textgreater{} 0.7
sec were on average above chance levels. In contrast, the CS in the
Object and Bullseye tasks never crossed the UCL, indicating that
children's shifts were equally likely to land on the target or the
distracter, regardless of when they were initiated. This result suggests
that first shifts measured in the Bullseye/Object tasks were
qualitatively different behaviors than those in the ASL and Face
contexts. That is, these shifts are likely the result of a different
generative process such as gathering more information about the
referents in the visual world.

Next, we compared the EWMA model fits for participants in the ASL and
Face processing contexts since these groups showed evidence of
language-driven responding. We found that ASL learners generated fewer
shifts when the CS was below the UCL compared to children learning
spoken language (\(\beta\) = 0.14, 95\% HDI {[}0.08, 0.23{]}). This
result indicates that ASL-learners were more likely to have gathered
sufficient information about the linguistic signal prior to shifting
gaze away from the language source. We found some evidence that ASL
learners started producing language-driven shifts earlier in the RT
distribution as indicated by the point at which the CS crossed the UCL
(\(\beta\) = 0.22 sec, 95\% HDI {[}0.05 sec, 0.39 sec{]}), indicating
that these children were less likely to generate early, random gaze
shifts away from the signer.

\emph{HDDM.} We fit a hierarchical Drift Diffusion Model using only the
gaze shifts categorized as language-driven by the EWMA. This allowed us
to ask what underlying decision processes are likely to account for the
measured differences in First Shift Accuracy and RT.\footnote{We chose
  not to interpret the HDDM fits for the Bullseye or Face tasks since
  there was no suggestion of any non-guessing signal from the EWMA
  analysis.} ASL learners had a higher estimate for the boundary
separation parameter compared to children processing spoken English from
a speaker (ASL boundary = 1.76, 95\% HDI {[}1.65, 1.88{]}; Face boundary
= 1.34, 95\% HDI {[}1.21, 1.47{]}), with no overlap in the credible
values (see Figure~\ref{fig:trio-model-plot}C). This suggests that ASL
learners' higher accuracy was driven by accumulating more evidence about
the linguistic signal before generating an eye movement. We found high
overlap for estimates of the drift rate parameter, indicating that both
groups processed the linguistic information with similar efficiency (ASL
drift = 0.63, 95\% HDI {[}0.44, 0.82{]}; Face drift = 0.55, 95\% HDI
{[}0.30, 0.80{]}).

\emph{Results summary.} Taken together, the behavioral and model-based
analyses provide converging support that ASL learners were sensitive to
the value of delaying eye movements away from the language source.
Compared to spoken language learners, ASL learners prioritized accuracy
over speed (HDDM), produced fewer nonlanguage-driven shifts away from
the center stimulus (EWMA), and were more accurate with these gaze
shifts (behavioral). Importantly, we did not see evidence in the HDDM
model fits that these accuracy differences could be explained by
differential efficiency in processing the linguistic information.
Instead, the pattern of results suggests that ASL learners increased
their decision threshold for generating a gaze shift away from a signer
to a named object.

We hypothesized that prioritizing accuracy of gaze shifts above speed of
responding when processing a visual-manual language is an adaptive
response. That is, to map referential language to the visual world in
ASL involves competition for visual attention. When ASL learners choose
to shift their gaze away from a signer, they are leaving an area that
provides a great deal of useful information. Moreover, unlike children
learning spoken languages, ASL learners cannot gather more of the
linguistic signal if their gaze is directed away from a signer. Thus, it
seems reasonable that ASL learners would adapt the timing of their gaze
shifts to gather additional information that increases certainty in
comprehension before seeking a named object.

It is important to point out that these findings were based on
exploratory analyses, and our information seeking account was developed
to explain this pattern of results. There are, however, several,
potentially important differences between the stimuli, apparatus, and
populations that limit the strength of our interpretation and the
generality of our account. Moreover, we cannot make causal conclusions
because we are comparing children learning different languages. Thus, we
designed Experiments 2 to address these concerns and set out to perform
well-controlled, experimental test of our information seeking
explanation of eye movements during grounded language comprehension.

\hypertarget{experiment-2}{%
\section{Experiment 2}\label{experiment-2}}

We designed Experiment 2 to be a well-controlled test of our information
seeking explanation of the differences between young ASL vs.~English
learners.\footnote{See \url{https://osf.io/g8h9r/} for a
  pre-registration of the analysis plan.} We measured adults and
children's eye movements during a real-time language comprehension task
where participants processed familiar sentences (e.g., \enquote{Where's
the ball?}) while looking at a simplified visual world with three
fixation targets. Using a within-participants design, we manipulated the
signal-to-noise (SnR) ratio of the auditory signal by convolving the
acoustic input with brown noise (random noise with greater energy at
lower frequencies). We chose to a noise manipulation because it allowed
us to increase the value of looking to a speaker for the task of
language comprehension and it could be used with both adults and
children.

We predicted that processing speech in a noisy context would make
participants less likely to shift before collecting sufficient
information. This delay, in turn, would lead to a lower proportion of
shifts flagged as random/exploratory in the EWMA analysis, and a pattern
of HDDM results indicating a prioritization of accuracy over and above
speed of responding. We also predicted a developmental difference: that
children would produce a higher proportion of random shifts and
accumulate information less efficiently compared to adults, and a
developmental parallel: that children would show the same pattern of
adapting gaze patterns to gather more visual information in the noisy
processing context.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods-1}}

\hypertarget{participants-1}{%
\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants-1}}

Participants were native, monolingual English-learning children (\(n=\)
39; 22 F) and adults (\(n=\) 31; 22 F). All participants had no reported
history of developmental or language delay and normal vision. 14
participants (11 children, 3 adults) were run but not included in the
analysis because either the eye tracker falied to calibrate (2 children,
3 adults) or the participant did not complete the task (9 children).

\hypertarget{stimuli-1}{%
\subsubsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli-1}}

\emph{Linguistic stimuli.} The video/audio stimuli were recorded in a
sound-proof room and featured two female speakers who used natural
child-directed speech and said one of two phrases: \enquote{Hey! Can you
find the (target word)} or "Look! Where's the (target word). The target
words were: ball, bunny, boat, bottle, cookie, juice, chicken, and shoe.
The target words varied in length (shortest = 411.68 ms, longest =
779.62 ms) with an average length of 586.71 ms.

\emph{Noise manipulation}. To create the stimuli in the noise condition,
we convolved each recording with Brown noise using the Audacity audio
editor. The average signal-to-noise ratio (values greater than 0 dB
indicate more signal than noise) in the noise condition was 2.87 dB
compared to the clear condition, which was 35.05 dB.

\emph{Visual stimuli.} The image set consisted of colorful digitized
pictures of objects presented in fixed pairs with no phonological
overlap between the target and the distracter image (cookie-bottle,
boat-juice, bunny-chicken, shoe-ball). The side of the target picture
was counterbalanced across trials.

\hypertarget{design-and-procedure-1}{%
\subsubsection{Design and procedure}\label{design-and-procedure-1}}

Participants viewed the task on a screen while their gaze was tracked
using an SMI RED corneal-reflection eye-tracker mounted on an LCD
monitor, sampling at 30 Hz. The eye-tracker was first calibrated for
each participant using a 6-point calibration. On each trial,
participants saw two images of familiar objects on the screen for two
seconds before the center stimulus appeared. Next, they processed the
target sentence -- which consisted of a carrier phrase, a target noun,
and a question -- followed by two seconds without language to allow for
a response. Child participants saw 32 trials (16 noise trials; 16 clear
trials) with several filler trials interspersed to maintain interest.
Adult participants saw 64 trials (32 noise; 32 clear). The noise
manipulation was presented in a blocked design with the order of block
counterbalanced across participants.

\hypertarget{behavioral-analyses-1}{%
\subsubsection{Behavioral analyses}\label{behavioral-analyses-1}}

\emph{Timecourse looking.} Figure~\ref{fig:noise-acc-rt-plot}A presents
an overview of looking to the speaker, target, and distracter images for
the noisy and clear processing contexts from the start of the target
noun. Similar to the results in Experiment 1 and 2, participants tended
to fixate on the speaker at target-noun onset. As the target noun
unfolded, the mean proportion looking to the center decreased rapidly as
participants shifted their gaze to the objects. Proportion looking to
the target increased sooner and reached a higher asymptote compared to
proportion looking to the distracter for all four processing contexts.
After looking to the target image, participants tended to shift their
gaze back to the speaker as shown by the increase in center looking
curve around 1 second.

There are several developmental differences to highlight. First,
children tended to look more to the objects at noun onset, as indicated
by the lower intercept of children's center-looking curves. Second,
children's target looking curves reached a lower asymptote as compared
to adults and they spent relatively more time fixating on the distracter
image, whereas adults rarely looked at the unnamed object after 0.5
seconds in the timecourse of the trial. And third, children showed a
stronger tendency to shift back to the speaker after looking to the
named object.

Visual inspection of the center looking curve suggests a key conditon
difference in looking behavior for the noisy processing context. That
is, both children and adult's spent more time fixating on the speaker
when the auditory signal was less reliable as indicated by the shift to
the right in the center-looking curves for the noisy context. A
cluster-based permutation test confirmed that there was evidence of a
significant difference in looking to the speaker between the Noisy and
Clear conditions (\(p < .05\)). This pattern of behavior provides
preliminary evidence that reducing the quality of the auditory signal
increased looking to the speaker early in the timecourse of the target
noun.

\emph{RT.} Figure~\ref{fig:noise-acc-rt-plot}A shows the full
distribution of the estimated RT differences between each participants'
performance in the noise and clear contexts. Both children and adults
were slower to identify the target in the noise condition (Children
\(M_{noise}\) = 500.20 ms; Adult \(M_{noise}\) = 595.20 ms), as compared
to the clear condition (Children \(M_{clear}\) = 455.70 ms Adult
\(M_{clear}\) = 542.40 ms). RTs in the noise condition were 48.80 ms
slower on average, with a 95\% HDI ranging from 3.70 ms to 96.30 ms, and
not including the null value of zero condition difference. Older
children responded faster than younger children (\(\beta_{age}\) =
-0.44, {[}-0.74, -0.16{]}), with little evidence for an interaction
between age and condition.

\emph{Accuracy.} Next, we modeled adults and children's first shift
accuracy using a mixed-effects logistic regression with the same
specifications (Figure~\ref{fig:noise-acc-rt-plot}B). Both groups were
more accurate than a model of random responding (null value of \(0.5\)
falling well outside the lower bound of the 95\% HDI for all group
means). Adults were more accurate (\(M_{adults} =\) 90\%) than children
(\(M_{children} =\) 61\%). The key result is that both groups showed
evidence of higher accuracy in the noise condition: children
(\(M_{noise}\) = 67\%; \(M_{clear}\) = 61\%) and adults (\(M_{noise}\) =
92\%; \(M_{clear}\) = 90\%). Accuracy in the noise condition was on
average 4\% higher, with a 95\% HDI from -1\% to 12\%. Note that the
null value of zero difference falls at the very edge of the HDI. But
95\% of the credible values are greater than zero, providing evidence
for higher accuracy in the noise condition. Within the child sample,
there was no evidence of a main effect of age or an interaction between
age and noise condition.

\hypertarget{model-based-analyses-1}{%
\subsubsection{Model-based analyses}\label{model-based-analyses-1}}

\textbf{EWMA.} Figure~\ref{fig:noise-model-plots}A shows the proportion
of shifts that the model classified as random vs.~language-driven for
each age group and processing context. On average, 41\% (95\% HDI: 32\%,
50\%) of children's shifts were categorized as language-driven, which
was significantly fewer than adults, 87\% (95\% HDI: 78\%, 96\%).
Critically, processing speech in a noisy context caused both adults and
children to generate a higher proportion of language-driven shifts
(i.e., fewer random, exploratory shifts away from the speaker), with the
95\% HDI excluding the null value of zero condition difference
(\(\beta_{noise}\) = 11\%, {[}7.00\%, 16\%{]}). Within the child sample,
older children generated fewer random, early shifts (\(M_{age}\) =
-0.21, {[}-0.35, -0.08{]}). There was no eivdence of an interaction
between age and condition. This pattern of results suggests that the
noise condition caused participants to increase visual fixations to the
language source, leading them to generate fewer exploratory, random
shifts before accumulating sufficient information to respond accurately.

\textbf{HDDM.} Figure~\ref{fig:noise-model-plots}B shows the full
posterior distributions for the HDDM output. Children had lower drift
rates (children \(M_{drift}\) = NA; adults \(M_{drift}\) = NA) and
boundary separation estimates (children \(M_{boundary}\) = 1.02; adults
\(M_{boundary}\) = 1.33) as compared to adults, suggesting that children
were less efficient and less cautious in their responding. The noise
manipulation selectively affected the boundary separation parameter,
with higher estimates in the noise condition for both age groups
(\(\beta_{noise}\) = 0.26, {[}0.10, 0.42{]}). This result suggests that
participants' in the noise condition prioritized information
accumulation over speed when generating an eye movement in response to
the incoming language. This increased decision threshold led to higher
accuracy. Moreover, the high overlap in estimates of drift rate suggests
that participants were able to integrate the visual and auditory signals
such that they could achieve a level of processing efficiency comparable
to the clear processing context.

Taken together, the behavioral and EWMA/HDDM results provide
confirmatory evidence for our information-seeking explanation of eye
movements. Processing speech in noise caused both children and adults to
seek additional visual information by looking longer to their social
partner to support language comprehension. Moreover, we observed a
similar pattern of behavior in children and adults, with both groups
producing more language-driven shifts and prioritizing accuracy over
speed in the more challenging noisy environment.

\hypertarget{general-discussion}{%
\section{General Discussion}\label{general-discussion}}

Language comprehension in grounded, social contexts provides children
access to a rich set of multimodal cues that could support linking
linguistic information to the world. But how do children select what
visual information to gather? In this work, we proposed that listeners
flexibly adapt their gaze to seek visual information from their social
partners when it was especially useful for language comprehension. We
presented evidence for our account by measuring changes in how children
chose to allocate visual attention across two diverse language
processing contexts. In Experiment 1, we found that, compared to
children learning spoken English, young ASL-learners delayed their gaze
shifts away from a language source, were more accurate, and produced a
smaller proportion of nonlanguage-driven eye movements. In Experiment 2,
we showed that 3-5 year-olds and adults delayed the timing of gaze
shifts away from a speaker's face while processing speech in a noisy
auditory environment. This slower response resulted in fewer
nonlanguage-driven eye movements and more accurate gaze shifts.

These results synthesize ideas from several research programs, including
work on language-mediated visual attention (Tanenhaus et al., 1995),
goal-based accounts of vision during everyday tasks (Hayhoe \& Ballard,
2005), and work on Language perception as multisensory integration
Vigliocco et al. (2014){]}. Moreover, our findings parallel the results
of several recent studies that measure the adaption of cognitive
processes in response to different environmental inputs. First, Heimler
et al. (2015) compared Deaf and hearing adults' performance on an
oculomotor additional singleton paradigm where participants made speeded
eye-movements to a unique orientation target embedded among distracters
that varied in saliency. Deaf adults were slower to generate a gaze
shift away from the center fixation and, as a result, they were less
affected by high saliency distracter objects. Second, recent work by
McMurray, Farris-Trimble, and Rigler (2017) found that individuals with
Cochlear Implants, who are consistently processing degraded auditory
input, are more likely to delay the process of lexical access as
measured by slower gaze shifts to named referents and fewer incorrect
gaze shifts to phonological onset competitors. McMurray et al. (2017)
also found that they could replicate these changes to gaze patterns in
adults with typical hearing by degrading the auditory stimuli so that it
shared features with the output of a cochlear implant (noise-vocoded
speech).

Our findings also contribute to the literature investigating how
experience with a visual-manual language may change basic cognitive
processes (see Bavelier, Dye, and Hauser (2006) for a review). The
upshot of this work is that the effects of Deafness can be dissociated
from the effects of learning a signed language. Specifically, Deaf
individuals show selective enhancement in peripheral visual attention as
evidenced by higher sensitivity to peripheral distracters on spatial
orienting tasks. In contrast, learning to sign results in several
specific changes such as enhanced mental imagery (Emmorey, Kosslyn, \&
Bellugi, 1993), mental rotation (Emmorey, Klima, \& Hickok, 1998), and
face processing (Bettger, Emmorey, McCullough, \& Bellugi, 1997). Our
results suggest that ASL learners adapt the timing of when they
disengage from a language source to increase their certainty before
seeking named object. It is an open question as to whether ASL-learners'
differential responding is best explained by lack of access to auditory
information or learning a visual-manual language.

Finally, our results dovetail with recent developmental work by Yurovsky
et al. (2017). In their study, preschoolers, like adults, were able to
integrate top-down expectations about the kinds of things speakers are
likely to talk about with bottom-up cues from auditory perception.
Yurovsky et al. (2017) situated this finding within the framework of
modeling language as a \emph{noisy channel} where listeners combine
expectations with perceptual data and weight each based on its
reliability. In Experiment 3, we found a similar developmental parallel
in language processing: that 3-5 year-olds, like adults, adapted their
gaze patterns to seek additional visual information when the auditory
signal became less reliable. This adaptation allowed listeners to
generate comparable, if not more, accurate responses in the noisy
context.

In sum, the work reported here shows that listeners will seek visual
information to integrate with the linguistic signal to support language
comprehension. These results dovetail with the models of language
processing reviewed earlier, suggesting that language perception is
interactive and draws on information from multiple modalities (MacDonald
\& Seidenberg, 2006; McClelland et al., 2006). These results also
highlight the value of studying language comprehension across a wider
variety of contexts than those typically studied in developmental
psycholinguistics.

\hypertarget{limitations-and-future-work}{%
\subsection{Limitations and future
work}\label{limitations-and-future-work}}

These results provide evidence that young listeners can adapt their gaze
patterns to the demands of different processing environments to seek
visual information from social partners that supports language
comprehension. We cannot, however, make claims about how children's
behavior in our task (the Visual World Paradigm: VWP) would generalize
to their decisions about how to distribute attention in real-world
learning environments. There is a large body of work showing meaningful
links between children's gaze behavior in the VWP and relevant outcome
measures such as vocabulary development. Nonetheless, a valuable next
step for our work would be to leverage tasks and measures that are come
closer to the ecological context in which children actually processs and
learn language such as using head-mounted cameras and eye trackers that
would allow measurement of where children choose to look during everyday
interactions (Fausey, Jayaraman, \& Smith, 2016; Franchak, Kretch,
Soska, \& Adolph, 2011).

This work has several other important limitations that pave the way for
future work. First, we chose to focus on a single decision about visual
fixation to provide a window onto the dynamics of decision-making across
different language processing contexts. But our analysis does not
consider the rich information present in the gaze patterns that occur
leading up to this decision. In our future work, we aim to measure how
changes in the language environment might lead to shifts in the dynamics
of gaze across a longer timescale. For example, perhaps listeners gather
more information about the objects in the scene before the sentence in
anticipation of allocating more attention to the speaker once they start
to speak.

Second, we chose one instantiation of a noisy processing context --
random background noise. But we think our findings should generalize to
contexts where other kinds of noise -- e.g., uncertainty over a
speaker's reliability or when processing accented speech -- make
gathering visual information from the speaker more useful for language
understanding. Moreover, we used a simple visual world, with only three
places to look, and simple linguistic stimuli. Thus it remains an open
question how these results might scale up to more complex language
interactions and visual environments. It could be that looks to a
speaker become even more useful for disambiguating reference in complex
visual environments.

Third, we do not yet know what might be driving the population
differences between children learning ASL and children learning spoken
English found in Experiment 1. It could be that ASL-learners' massive
experience dealing with competition for visual attention leads to
changes in the deployment of eye movements during language
comprehension. Or, it could be that the in-the-moment constraints of
processing a visual language cause different fixation behaviors. This
question could be addressed by studies that measure how quickly
listeners adapt the dynamics of gaze when visual information becomes
more useful. Another interesting approach would be to measure eye
movements in hearing children learning both a signed and a spoken
language (bimodal bilinguals). This comparison between native hearing
and deaf signers would allow for a dissociation of the effects of
learning a visual-manual language from the effects of lacking access to
auditory information (e.g., Bavelier et al., 2006). If hearing signers
also prioritize accuracy over speed when processing their spoken
language, this would suggest that experience with a visual-manual
language is changing a general response strategy.

Finally, our eye tracking paradigm removes an important component of
successful communication: dynamic interaction between the speaker and
listener. It is interesting to consider how speakers might adapt their
behavior present the listener with useful visual information in
challenging comprehension contexts. For example, in noisy environments,
speakers will exaggerate mouth movements (Fitzpatrick, Kim, \& Davis,
2011) and increase the frequency of gestural cues such as head nodding
(Munhall, Jones, Callan, Kuratate, \& Vatikiotis-Bateson, 2004), and
parents exaggerate mouth movements during infant-directed speech (Green,
Nip, Wilson, Mefferd, \& Yunusova, 2010). Moreover, observational
studies of parent-child interactions in signed languages show
variability in how sensitive adult signers are to the competing demands
on children's visual attention (Harris \& Mohay, 1997). That is, some
interactions contain many utterances that young signers miss because
they are fixating on objects; whereas other interactions are marked by
adaptations that accommodate the demands on visual attention by parents
displacing signs onto the objects that are currently the focus of
children's attention (similar to follow-in labeling effects Tomasello
and Farrar, 1986). Thus it is an interesting, open question how
interacting with a speaker that adapts to increase the availability and
utility of visual information might change children's decisions about
visual fixation.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

In this paper, we presented an information-seeking explanation for the
differences in the dynamics of eye movements during grounded signed
vs.~spoken language comprehension. We started from an interesting,
observational result: that ASL learners, compared to English-learning
children, generate slower but more accurate gaze shifts away from a
language source and to a named referent. We then tested the generality
and causal claims of our account by experimentally manipulating the
value of visual information for language comprehension. We found that
even young listeners adapt the dynamics of their gaze to gather visual
information when it is useful for language understanding.

While we chose to start with the domain of familiar language processing,
we think the account is more general and could could be applied to the
language acquisition context. Consider that early in language learning,
children are acquiring novel word-object links while also learning about
visual object categories. Both of these tasks produce different goals
that should, in turn, modulate children's decisions about where to
allocate visual attention -- e.g., seeking nonlinguistic cues to
reference such as eye gaze and pointing become critical when you are
unfamiliar with the information in the linguistic signal. More
generally, this framework presents a way forward for explaining links
between decisions about visual fixation, language comprehension, and
acquisition across a wider set of processing contexts and at different
stages of development.
