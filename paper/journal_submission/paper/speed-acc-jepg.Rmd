abstract: |
  Understanding grounded language involves mapping the incoming linguistic signal onto the visual world. Information that is gathered through visual fixations can facilitate comprehension. But how do listeners decide what visual information to gather and at what time? Here, we propose that listeners flexibly adapt their gaze to seek visual information from social partners to support language understanding. We present evidence for our account using three case studies of eye movements during real-time language processing. First, compared to children learning spoken English (n=80), young ASL-learners (n=30) delayed gaze shifts away from a language source, were more accurate and produced a smaller proportion of nonlanguage-driven shifts. Second, English-speaking adults (n=24) produced fewer random gaze shifts when processing serially-presented text compared to processing spoken language. Finally, English-speaking preschoolers (n=39) and adults (n=31) delayed the timing of gaze shifts away from a speaker while processing speech in noisy environments, which resulted in more more accurate responding. These results provide converging evidence that listeners adapt their gaze to seek supportive visual information from their social partners.

# Introduction 

Extracting meaning from language represents a formidable challenge for young language learners. Consider that even in the simple case of understanding grounded, familiar language (e.g., â€œlook at the ball"), the listener must integrate linguistic and non-linguistic information from continuous streams of input. Moreover, language unfolds within dynamic interactions where there is often insufficient information to figure out what is being said, and yet the listener must decide how best to respond. Despite these challenges even young children are capable of mapping language to the world quite efficiently, shifting visual attention to a named object in a scene within hundreds of milliseconds upon hearing the name of a familiar object [@spivey2002eye; @allopenna1998tracking; @tanenhaus1995integration]. How do young listeners interpret language despite noisy input and their limited processing capabilities? 

One solution is for children to integrate multiple sources of information to constrain the set of possible interpretations [@mcclelland1986trace; @macdonald2006constraint]. Under this interactive account, listeners comprehend words by partially activating several candidates that are consistent with incoming perceptual information. Then, as more information arrives, words that do not match the perceptual signal are no longer considered, and words that are more consistent become strongly activated until a single interpretation is reached (see @mcclelland2006there for a review). Critically, information from multiple sources -- the linguistic signal, visual world, and conceptual knowledge -- mutually influence one another to shape interpretation. For example, if a speaker's mouth movements suggest one sound while their acoustic output indicates another, the interaction results in the listener perceiving a third, intermediate sound ("McGurk effect") [@macdonald1978visual]. Other research in psycholinguistics shows that listeners will use information in the visual scene to help them parse syntactically ambiguous utterances [@tanenhaus1995integration].

Thus, information gathered from the visual world can facilitate language comprehension. But the incoming linguistic signal is ephemeral and mutliple fixation behaviors could be useful, meaning that listeners must quickly decide how to direct their gaze to informative locations in the environment. Consider a speaker who asks you to "Pass the salt" in a noisy restaurant. Here, comprehension could be supported by looks to the objects in the scene (e.g., the type of food she is eating), or by looks to the speaker (e.g., reading her lips or the direction of her gaze). A second interesting case is comprehension of visual-manual language such as American Sign Language (ASL). In this context, fixations to other people are highly informative because linguistic information is processed via the visual channel. Moreover, the decision to look away from another signer to the rest of the visual scene is potentially risky because shifting gaze reduces visual access to subsquent linguistic information.

These examples highlight how eye movements can be characterized as an active decision-making process where listeners aim to maximize the amount of language-relevant information they gather over time. Here, we pursue this idea and propose that listeners are sensitive to the value of different fixation behaviors for the goal of grounded language understanding. We hypothesize that even young children can flexibly adapt the dynamics of their gaze to seek higher value visual information to aid comprehension. At the core of the account is the idea that eye movements are shaped by a coupling between the listener's sensorimotor constraints and access to language-relevant information in the visual world.

These ideas are inspired by ideas from several research programs. First, work on language-mediated visual attention showing rapid interactions between visual attention and language [@allopenna1998tracking; @tanenhaus1995integration]. Second, research on vision in everyday tasks shows that people allocate fixations to *goal-relevant* locations -- e.g., an upcoming obstacle while walking [@hayhoe2005eye]. Finally, work on multisensory integration showing that listeners leverage multimodal cues (e.g., gestures, facial expressions, mouth movements) to support communication. In the following sections, we briefly review each of these literatures to motivate our information-seeking account of eye movements in social, grounded language comprehension.

## Vision-Language interactions during language comprehension 

Eye movements during language comprehension have provided insight into the interaction between concepts, language, and visual attention. The majority of this work has used the Visual World Paradigm (VWP) where listeners' eye movements are recorded at the millisecond timescale while processing language and looking at a set of objects (see @salverda2011goal for a review). Crucially, these analyses rely on the fact that people will initiate gaze shifts to named referents with only partial information, in contrast to waiting until the end of a cognitive process [@gold2000representation]. Thus, the timecourse of eye movements provides a window onto how and when people integrate information to reach an interpretation of the incoming linguistic signal. 
	
A classic finding using the VWP shows that listeners will rapidly shift visual attention upon hearing the name of an object ("Pick up a beaker.") in the visual scene with a high proportion of shifts occurring soon after the target word begins  [@allopenna1998tracking]. Moreover, adults tended to look at phonological onset-competitor (a beetle) early in the target noun, suggesting that they had activated multiple interpretations and resolved ambiguity as the stimulus unfolded. These behavioral results fall out of predictions made by interactive models of speech perception where information from multiple sources is integrated to constrain language understanding [@mcclelland2006there]. 

The visual world can also constrain the set of plausible interpretations of language [@dahan2005looking; @yee2006eye]. For example, @altmann2007real showed that people will allocate more looks to an empty wine glass as compared to a full beer glass upon hearing the past tense verb "has drunk." They propose that anticipatory eye movements reflect the influence of the visual information in a scene activating a multi-featured, conceptual representation prior to the arrival of the linguistic signal (see also @huettig2005word).

In addition to work on adult psycholinguistics, the VWP has been useful for studying developmental change in language comprehension skill in children. Researchers have adapted the task to measure the timing and accuracy of children's gaze shifts as they look at two familiar objects and listen to simple sentences naming one of the objects [@fernald2008looking; @venker2013individual]. Such research finds that children, like adults, shift gaze to named objects occur soon after the auditory information is sufficient to enable referent identification. Moreover, individual differences in the speed and accuracy of eye movements predict vocabulary growth and later language and cognitive outcomes [@fernald2006picking; @marchman2008speed; @rigler2015slow]. Finally, the VWP has illustrated interesting developmental parallels and differences between children's language processing in different populations, including sign language [@macdonald2018real], bilingualism [@byers2017bilingual], and children with cochlear implants [@schwartz2013language]. 

## Goal-based accounts of eye movements in everyday tasks

The majority of the work on language-driven visual attention has used eye movements as an index of the underlying interaction between linguistic and visual information. This approach reflects a somewhat passive construal of how people allocate visual attention during language comprehension. In contrast, goal-based accounts of vision start from the idea that eye movements reflect an active information-gathering process where visual fixations are driven by task goals [@hayhoe2005eye]. 

Under this account, people allocate visual attention to reduce uncertainty about the world and maximize their expected future rewards with respect to some goal. For example, @hayhoe2005eye review evidence that people fixate on locations that are most helpful for their current task (e..g, looks to an upcoming obstacle when walking) as opposed to other aspects of a visual scene that might be more salient (a flashing light). Moreover, other work shows that people gather task-specific information via different visual routines as they become useful for their goals. For example, @triesch2003you found that people were less likely to gather and store visual information about the size of an object when it was not relevant to the task of sorting and stacking the objects.
					
@hayhoe2005eye's review also highlights the role of learning gaze patterns. They point out that visual routines are developed over time, and it is only when a task becomes highly-practiced that people allocate fewer looks to less-relevant parts of the scene. For example, @shinoda2001controls show that skilled drivers learn to spread visual attention more broadly at intersections to better detect stop signs. Other empirical work shows that the visual system rapidly learns to use temporal regularities in the environment to control the timing of eye movements to detect goal-relevant events [@hoppe2016learning]. Moreover, the timing of eye movements in these tasks often occur before an expected event, suggesting that gaze patterns reflect an interaction between people's expectations, the information available in the visual scene, and their task goals.

Recent theoretical work has argued for a stronger link between these goal-based perspectives and work on eye movements during language comprehension. @salverda2011goal highlight the immediate relevance of visual information with respect to the goal of language understanding, suggesting that listeners' goals should be a key predictor of fixation patterns. Moreover, they point out that factors such as the difficulty of executing a real world task should change decisions about where to look during language comprehension. One example of starting from a goal-based approach comes from @nelson2007probabilistic's study of gaze patterns during category learning. @nelson2007probabilistic modeled eye movements as a type of question-asking behavior and showed that as participants became more familiar with novel concepts their gaze patterns shifted from exploratory to efficient, suggesting that fixations changed as a function of learning goals during the task.		

In the current studies, the goal-based model of eye movements predicts that gaze during language comprehension should adapt to the processing context. That is, listeners should change the timing and location of eye movements when fixation locations become more useful for comprehension. This proposal dovetails with a growing body of research that explores the effects of multisensory (gesture, prosody, facial expression and body movement) integration on language perception and comprehension. 

## Language perception as multisensory integration 

Language comprehension does not just involve a single stream of linguistic information. Instead, face-to-face communication provides the listener with access to a set of multimodal cues that can facilitate understanding. There is a growing emphasis on studying language as a multimodal and multisensory process (for a review, see @vigliocco2014language). For example, empirical work shows that when gesture and speech provide redundant cues to meaning, people are faster to process the information and make fewer errors [@kelly2010two]. Moreover, developmental work shows that parents use visual cues such as gesture and eye gaze to structure language interactions with their children [@estigarribia2007getting]. Finally, from a young age, children also produce gestures such as reaches and points to share attention with others to achieve communicative goals [@liszkowski2012prelinguistic]. 

Additional support for multisensory processing comes from work on audiovisual speech perception, showing how spoken language perception is shaped by visual information coming from a speaker's mouth. In a review, @peelle2015prediction point out that mouth movements provide a clear indication of when someone has started to speak, which cues the listener to allocate additional attention to the speech signal. Moreover, a speaker's mouth movements convey information about the phonemes in the acoustic signal. For example, visual speech information distinguishes between consonants such as **/b/** vs. **/d/** and place of articulation can help a listener differentiate between words such as "cat" or "cap." Finally, classic empirical work shows benefits for audiovisual speech perception compared to auditory- or visual-only speech perception, especially in noisy listening contexts [@erber1969interaction].

In sum, the work on multisensory processing shows that both auditory and visual information interact to shape language perception. These results parallel claims of the interactive models of language processing reviewed earlier and suggest that visual information should be considered as an input to language comprehension [@mcclelland2006there; @macdonald2006constraint]. Finally, this work highlight the value of studying language comprehension during face-to-face communication, where listeners can choose to look at their social partners to gather language-releveant visual information.

## The present studies

The studies reported here characterize language processing as a multimodal, goal-based, and social phenomenon. We propose an information-seeking account of eye movements during grounded language comprehension in both signed and spoken language: The timing of gaze shifts reflect a maximization of gathering language-relevant visual information from a speaker balanced with fixating on surrounding visual scene. We draw on models of eye movements as active decisions that gather information to achieve reliable interpretations of incoming language and test predictions of our account using three case studies of processing sign language, serially-presented text, and spoken language in noisy environments. These cases represent a broad sampling of contexts that share a key feature: The interaction between the listener and environment changes the value of fixating on the source of language to support comprehension.

A secondary goal of this work was to test whether children and adults would show similar patterns of gaze adaptation. Recent developmental work shows that, like adults, preschoolers will flexibly adjust how they interpret ambiguous sentences (e.g., "I had carrots and *bees* for dinner.") by integrating information about the reliability of the incoming perceptual information with their expectations about the speaker [@yurovsky2017preschoolers]. While children's behavior paralleled adults, they relied more on top-down expectations about the speaker, perhaps because their perceptual representations were noisier. These developmental differences provide insight into how children succeed in understanding language despite having partial knowledge of word-object mappings.

The structure of the paper is as follows. First, we compare children and adult's eye movements while processing signed vs. spoken language. Then, we present a study of adults' eye movements while processing serially-presented text as compared to spoken language. Finally, we compare children and adults' gaze patterns while they process speech in noisy vs. clear auditory environments. The key behavioral prediction is that both children and adults will adapt the timing of their eye movements to facilitate word recognition. We hypothesized that as a language source provides higher value visual information, listeners should prioritize fixations to their social partner, and would be (a) slower to shift gaze away, which in turn would lead to (b) more accurate responding and (c) fewer nonlanguage-driven eye movements to the *rest* of the visual world. 

Before describing the studies, it is worth motivating our analytic approach. To quantify evidence for our predictions, we analyze the accuracy and reaction times (RTs) of listeners' initial gaze shifts after hearing the name of an object. The timescale of this analysis is milliseconds and focuses on a single decision within a series of decisions about where to look during language processing. We chose this approach because first shifts are rapid decisions driven by accumulating information about the identity of the named object and thus provide a window onto changes in the underlying dynamics of how listeners integrate linguistic and visual information. Finally, by focusing our analysis on a specific, discrete choice, we could leverage cognitive models of decision making developed over the past forty years (the Drift Diffusion Model [@ratcliff2008diffusion]) that quantify changes in the underlying psychological processes that generate fixation decisions.

                                        stimuli))),
         stimuli = factor(stimuli, levels = c("ASL", "Face", "Object", "Bullseye")))

d.signs.length <- read_csv(here::here("data/0b_trial_information/sol_target_sign_lengths_all.csv"))
```

Experiment 1 provides an initial test of our information seeking account. We compared eye movements of children learning American Sign Language to children learning a spoken language using parallel real-time language comprehension tasks where children processed familiar sentences (e.g., "Where's the ball?") while looking at a simplified visual world with three fixation targets (a center stimulus that varied by condition, a target picture, and a distracter picture; see Figure\ \ref{fig:trio-stim}). The spoken language data are a reanalysis of three unpublished data sets, and the ASL data are reported in @macdonald2018real. Our primary question of interest is whether processing a sign language like ASL would increase the value of fixating on the language source and decrease the value of generating exploratory, nonlanguage-driven shifts even after the disambiguation point in the linguistic signal. If ASL learners are sensitive to the cost of shifting gaze away from a signer, then they would show evidence of prioritizing accuracy over and above speed of shifting gaze to the named object.

## Analysis plan

To quantify changes in the process of generting eye movements we use three analyses. First, we present behavioral analyses of the timecourse of looking to each area of interest (AOI), along with analyses of First Shift Accuracy and Reaction Time (RT). RT corresponds to the latency of shifting gaze away from the central stimulus to either object measured from the onset of the target noun ^[All reaction time distributions were trimmed to between zero and two seconds and RTs were modeled in log space.]. Accuracy corresponds to whether participants' first gaze shift landed on the target or the distracter object. It is important to note that this analysis of accuracy does not focus on the amount of time spent looking at the target vs. the distracter image â€“ a measure typically used in analyses of the Visual World Paradigm. We chose to focus primarily on first shifts to provide a window onto changes in the underlying dynamics of information gathering decisions. All analysis code can be found in the online repository for this project: https://github.com/kemacdonald/speed-acc.

We used the `rstanarm` [@gabry2016rstanarm] package to fit Bayesian mixed-effects regression models. The mixed-effects approach allowed us to model the nested structure of our data -- multiple trials for each participant and item, and a within-participants manipulation -- by including random intercepts for each participant and item, and a random slope for each item and noise condition. We used Bayesian estimation to quantify uncertainty in our point estimates, which we communicate using a 95% Highest Density Interval (HDI). The HDI provides a range of credible values given the data and model. Finally, to estimate age-related differences, we fit two types of models: (1) age group (adults vs. children) as a categorical predictor and (2) age as a continuous predictor (measured in days) within the child sample.

Next, we present two model-based analyses. The goal of these models is to move beyond a description of the data and map behavioral differences in eye movements to underlying psychological variables. The Exponetially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) models changes in the tendency to generate random gaze shifts as a function of RT [@vandekerckhove2007fitting]. For each RT, the model generates two values: a "control statistic" (CS, which captures the running average accuracy of first shifts) and an "upper control limit" (UCL, which captures the pre-defined limit of when accuracy would be categorized as better than guessing). Here, the CS is an expectation of random shifting to either the target or the distracter image (nonlanguage-driven shifts), or a Bernoulli process with probability of success 0.5. As RTs get slower, we assume that participants have gathered more information and should become more accurate (i.e., language-driven), or a Bernoulli process with probability success > 0.5. Using this model, we can quantify the proportion of gaze shifts that were language-driven as opposed to guessing. 

Finally, following @vandekerckhove2007fitting, we selected shifts categorized as language-driven by the EWMA and fit a hierarchical Bayesian Drift-Diffusion Model (HDDM). The HDDM quantifies differences in the underlying decision process that lead to different patterns of behavior. The model assumes that people accumulate noisy evidence in favor of one alternative with a response generated when the evidence crosses a pre-defined decision threshold. We chose to implement a hierarchical Bayesian version of the DDM using the HDDM Python package [@wiecki2013hddm] since we had relatively few trials from child participants and recent simulation studies have shown that the HDDM approach was better than other fitting methods for small data sets [@ratcliff2015individual]. Here, we focus on two parameters of interest: *boundary separation*, which indexes the amount of evidence gathered before generating a response (higher values suggest more cautious responding) and *drift rate*, which indexes the amount of evidence accumulated per unit time (higher values suggest more efficient processing). 

## Methods

### Participants

```{r trio get participant info}
trio_n <- df_trio %>% 
  select(Sub.Num, stimuli, age_code) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  mutate(`Center Stimulus` = stimuli) %>% 
  group_by(`Center Stimulus`, age_code) %>%
  tally()
```

```{r trio make participants table, results="asis"}
trio_tab <- df_trio %>% 
  filter(age_code == "child") %>% 
  select(Sub.Num, stimuli, Months) %>% 
  mutate(`Center Stimulus` = stimuli) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  group_by(`Center Stimulus`) %>% 
  summarise(Mean = round(mean(Months), 1),
            Min = min(Months),
            Max = max(Months)) %>% 
  left_join(., filter(trio_n, age_code == "child")) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 1) %>% 
  select(-age_code)

apa_table(
  trio_tab
  , caption = "Age distributions of children in Experiment 1. All ages are reported in months."
)
```

```{r trio get kid sample sizes}
kids_n <- df_trio %>% 
  filter(age_code == "child") %>% 
  select(Sub.Num, stimuli, Months, hearing_status_participant) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  group_by(stimuli, hearing_status_participant) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

spoken_eng_n <- kids_n %>% filter(stimuli != "ASL") %>% .$n %>%  sum()
asl_n <- kids_n %>% filter(stimuli == "ASL") %>% .$n %>%  sum()
hearing_n <- kids_n %>% filter(stimuli == "ASL", hearing_status_participant == "hearing") %>% .$n
deaf_n <- kids_n %>% filter(stimuli == "ASL", hearing_status_participant == "deaf") %>% .$n
```

Table 1 contains details about the age distributions of children in all four samples. 

*Spoken English samples.* Participants were `r spoken_eng_n` native, monolingual English-learning children divided across three samples with no reported history of developmental or language delay.

*ASL sample.* Participants were `r asl_n` native, monolingual ASL-learning children (`r deaf_n` deaf, `r hearing_n` hearing). All children, regardless of hearing status, were exposed to ASL from birth through extensive interaction with at least one caregiver fluent in ASL and were reported to experience at least 80% ASL in their daily lives. The ASL sample included a wider age range compared to the spoken English samples because this is a rare population.

```

There are differences between ASL and English question structures. However, all linguistic stimuli shared the same trial structure: language to attract participants' attention followed by a sentence containing a target noun.

*ASL linguistic stimuli.* We recorded two sets of ASL stimuli, using two valid ASL sentence structures for questions: 1) Sentence-initial wh-phrase: "HEY! WHERE [target noun]?" and 2) Sentence-final wh-phrase: "HEY! [target noun] WHERE?" Two female native ASL users recorded several tokens of each sentence in a child-directed register. Before each sentence, the signer produced a common attention-getting gesture. Mean sign length was `r ms_sign_len$m` ms, ranging from `r ms_sign_len$min_l` ms to `r ms_sign_len$max_l` ms

*English linguistic stimuli.* All three tasks (Object, Bullseye, and Face) featured the same female speaker who used natural child-directed speech and said: "Look! Where's the (target word)?" The target words were: ball, banana, book, cookie, juice, and shoe. For the Face task, a female native English speaker was video-recorded as she looked straight ahead and said, "Look! Where's the (target word)?" Mean word length was `r ms_word_len$m[1]` ms, ranging from `r ms_word_len$min_l[1]` ms to `r ms_word_len$max_l[1]` ms.

*ASL and English visual stimuli.* The image set consisted of colorful digitized pictures of objects presented in fixed pairs with no phonological overlap (ASL task: catâ€”bird, carâ€”book, bearâ€”doll, ballâ€”shoe; English tasks: book-shoe, juice-banana, cookie-ball). Side of target picture was counterbalanced across trials.

*Trial structure.* On each trial, the child saw two images of familiar objects on the screen for two seconds before the center stimulus appeared. This time allowed the child to visually explore both images. Next, the target sentence -- which consisted of a carrier phrase, target noun, and question sign -- was presented, followed by two seconds without language to allow the child to respond to the signer's sentence. The trial structure of the Face, Object, and Bullseye tasks were highly similar: children were given two seconds to visually explore the objects prior to the appearance of the center stimulus, then processed a target sentence, and finally were given two seconds of silence to generate a response to the target noun.

### Design and procedure

Children sat on their caregiver's lap and viewed the task on a screen while their gaze was recorded using a digital camcorder. On each trial, children saw two images of familiar objects on the screen for two seconds before the center stimulus appeared (see Figure\ \ref{fig:trio-stim})). Then they processed the target sentence -- which consisted of a carrier phrase, a target noun, and a question -- followed by two seconds without language to allow for a response. Participants saw 32 test trials with several filler trials interspersed to maintain interest.

*Coding.* Participants' gaze patterns were coded (33-ms resolution) as being fixated on either the center stimulus, one of the images, shifting between pictures, or away. To assess inter-coder reliability, 25% of the videos were re-coded. Agreement was scored at the level of individual frames of video and averaged 98% on these reliability assessments.

*Timecourse looking.* The first question of interest was how do young ASL and English learners distribute attention across the three fixation locations while processing language in real-time? Figure\ \ref{fig:speed-acc-trio-plot}A presents an overview of children's looking to the center, target, and distracter images for each processing context. This plot shows changes in the mean proportion of trials on which participants fixated the signer, the target image, or the distracter image at every 33-ms interval of the stimulus sentence. At target-noun onset, children tended to look at the center. As the target noun unfolded, the mean proportion looking to the center decreased rapidly as participants shifted their gaze to the target or the distracter image. Proportion looking to the target increased sooner and reached a higher asymptote, compared to proportion looking to the distracter, for all four processing contexts. 

After looking to the target image, participants tended to shift their gaze back to the center, shown by the increase in proportion looking to the center around two seconds after target-noun onset. There were several qualitative differences in looking behavior across the different center stimulus types. First, both ASL- and English-learners who processed sentences from a video of speaker spent more time looking to the center as indicated by the shallower slope on their center-looking curves. Second, when the center stimulus was a static geometric object (Bullseye) or a static familiar object (Object), spoken language learners were more likely to look at the distracter image, especially early in the timecourse of the target noun as indicated by the parallel increase in target and distracter-looking curves in Figure\ \ref{fig:speed-acc-trio-plot}A. In contrast, spoken language learners in the Face context spent less time looking at the disracter, and ASL-learners rarely looked to the distracter image at any point in the trial. This pattern of behavior provides qualitative evidence that children adapated their gaze depending on information available in the visual world and the modality of their language.

We tested differences in proportion looking to the center using a nonparametric cluster-based permutation analysis, which accounts for the issue of taking multiple comparisons across many time bins in the timecourse [@maris2007nonparametric]. The center-looking curve for the ASL learners was significantly different from all other conditions (all $p < .001$). Within the spoken language groups, children's looking to a speaker's face was different from looking to the Bullseye and the Familar object ($p < .001$). Finally, the Object and Bullseye center-looking curves were not different from one another, with no significant differences at any point in the timecourse. Next, we ask how these different processing contexts changed the timing and accuracy of children's initial decisions to shift away from the center stimulus.

*RT.* Figure\ \ref{fig:speed-acc-trio-plot}B shows the full RT data distribution. To quantify differences across the groups, we fit a Bayesian linear mixed-effects regression predicting first shift RT as a function of center stimulus type controlling for age: \texttt{Log(RT) $\sim$ center stimulus type + age +  (1 | subject) + (1 | item)}. ASL learners generated slower RTs compared to all of the spoken English samples ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$rt[2]` ms, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$hdi_lower[2]` ms, `r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$hdi_upper[2]` ms]). Moreover, ASL learners' shifts were slower compared directly to children processing spoken language in the Face condition ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$rt[1]` ms, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$hdi_lower[1]` ms, `r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$hdi_upper[1]` ms]). Finally, children in the Face context shifted gaze slower compared to participants in the Object and Bullseye contexts ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$rt[3]` ms, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$hdi_lower[3]` ms, `r ms_contrasts_trio_rt$hdi_upper[3]` ms]).

*Accuracy.* Next, we compared the accuracy of first shifts across the different tasks (Figure\ \ref{fig:speed-acc-trio-plot}C) by fitting a mixed-effects logistic regression with the same specifications and contrasts as the RT model. We found that (a) ASL learners were more accurate compared to all of the spoken English samples ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$prop[2]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_lower[2]`], `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_upper[2]`), (b) ASL learners were more accurate when directly compared to participants in the Face task ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$prop[1]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_lower[1]`, `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_upper[1]`]), (c) children learning spoken language were more accurate when processing language from dynamic video of a person speaking compared to the Object and Bullseye tasks ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$prop[4]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_lower[4]`, `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_upper[4]`]), and (d) English-learners' first shifts were no different from random responding in the Object ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$prop[5]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_lower[5]`, `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_upper[5]`]) and Bullseye ($\beta$ = `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$prop[3]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_lower[3]`, `r ms_contrasts_trio_acc$hdi_upper[3]`]) contexts.

  mutate_if(.predicate = is.numeric, .funs = round, digits = 2) 
```

*EWMA.* Our third question of interest was how the tendency to generate random vs. language-driven (i.e, accurate) gaze shifts evolved as a function of reaction time across the different processing contexts. Figure\ \ref{fig:trio-model-plot}A shows changes in the control statistic (CS, weighted moving average) and the upper control limit (UCL, upper threshold on guessing) as a function of RT. Each CS starts at chance performance and below the UCL. In the ASL and Face tasks, the CS value begins to increase with RTs around 0.7 seconds after noun onset and eventually crosses the UCL, indicating that responses > 0.7 sec were on average above chance levels. In contrast, the CS in the Object and Bullseye tasks never crossed the UCL, indicating that children's shifts were equally likely to land on the target or the distracter, regardless of when they were initiated. This result suggests that first shifts measured in the Bullseye/Object tasks were qualitatively different behaviors than those in the ASL and Face contexts. That is, these shifts are likely the result of a different generative process such as gathering more information about the referents in the visual world.

Next, we compared the EWMA model fits for participants in the ASL and Face processing contexts since these groups showed evidence of language-driven responding. We found that ASL learners generated fewer shifts when the CS was below the UCL compared to children learning spoken language ($\beta$ = `r ms_guess_trio_contrast$MAP[1]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_guess_trio_contrast$hdi_lower[1]`, `r ms_guess_trio_contrast$hdi_upper[1]`]). This result indicates that ASL-learners were more likely to have gathered sufficient information about the linguistic signal prior to shifting gaze away from the language source. We found some evidence that ASL learners started producing language-driven shifts earlier in the RT distribution as indicated by the point at which the CS crossed the UCL ($\beta$ = `r ms_cuts_trio_contrast$MAP[1]` sec, 95% HDI [`r ms_cuts_trio_contrast$hdi_lower[1]` sec, `r ms_cuts_trio_contrast$hdi_upper[1]` sec]), indicating that these children were less likely to generate early, random gaze shifts away from the signer.

  mutate_at(vars(Mean, HDI_lower, HDI_upper), round, digits = 2)
```

*HDDM.* We fit a hierarchical Drift Diffusion Model using only the gaze shifts categorized as language-driven by the EWMA. This allowed us to ask what underlying decision processes are likely to account for the measured differences in First Shift Accuracy and RT. ^[We chose not to interpret the HDDM fits for the Bullseye or Face tasks since there was no suggestion of any non-guessing signal from the EWMA analysis.] ASL learners had a higher estimate for the boundary separation parameter compared to children processing spoken English from a speaker (ASL boundary = `r ms.hddm_trio$Mean[1]`, 95% HDI [`r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_lower[1]`, `r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_upper[1]`]; Face boundary = `r ms.hddm_trio$Mean[2]`, 95% HDI [`r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_lower[2]`, `r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_upper[2]`]), with no overlap in the credible values (see Figure\ \ref{fig:trio-model-plot}C). This suggests that ASL learners' higher accuracy was driven by accumulating more evidence about the linguistic signal before generating an eye movement. We found high overlap for estimates of the drift rate parameter, indicating that both groups processed the linguistic information with similar efficiency (ASL drift = `r ms.hddm_trio$Mean[3]`, 95% HDI [`r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_lower[3]`, `r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_upper[3]`]; Face drift = `r ms.hddm_trio$Mean[4]`, 95% HDI [`r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_lower[4]`, `r ms.hddm_trio$HDI_upper[4]`]).

*Results summary.* Taken together, the behavioral and model-based analyses provide converging support that ASL learners were sensitive to the value of delaying eye movements away from the language source. Compared to spoken language learners, ASL learners prioritized accuracy over speed (HDDM), produced fewer nonlanguage-driven shifts away from the center stimulus (EWMA), and were more accurate with these gaze shifts (behavioral). Importantly, we did not see evidence in the HDDM model fits that these accuracy differences could be explained by differential efficiency in processing the linguistic information.  Instead, the pattern of results suggests that ASL learners increased their decision threshold for generating a gaze shift away from a signer to a named object.

We hypothesized that prioritizing accuracy of gaze shifts above speed of responding when processing a visual-manual language is an adaptive response. That is, to map referential language to the visual world in ASL involves competition for visual attention. When ASL learners choose to shift their gaze away from a signer, they are leaving an area that provides a great deal of useful information. Moreover, unlike children learning spoken languages, ASL learners cannot gather more of the linguistic signal if their gaze is directed away from a signer. Thus, it seems reasonable that ASL learners would adapt the timing of their gaze shifts to gather additional information that increases certainty in comprehension before seeking a named object.

It is important to point out that these findings were based on exploratory analyses, and our information seeking account was developed to explain this pattern of results. There are, however, several, potentially important differences between the stimuli, apparatus, and populations that limit the strength of our interpretation and the generality of our account. Moreover, we cannot make causal conclusions because we are comparing children learning different languages. Thus, we designed Experiments 2 and 3 to address these concerns and set out to perform well-controlled, experimental tests of our information seeking account of eye movements in grounded, social language comprehension.

# Experiment 2

In Experiment 2, we aimed to replicate a key finding from Experiment 1: that increasing the competition between fixating on a language source and the nonlinguistic visual world reduces nonlanguage-driven eye movements. Moreover, we conducted a confirmatory test of our hypothesis that controlled for the population differences present in Experiment 1. We tested a sample of English-speaking adults using a within-participants manipulation of the language-relevance of the center stimulus. We used the Face and Bullseye stimulus sets from Experiment 1 and added two new conditions: (1) Text, where the verbal language information was accompanied by a word-by-word display of printed text (see Figure\ \ref{fig:trio-stim}), and Text-no-audio, where the spoken language stimulus was removed. We chose text processing since, like sign language comprehension, information relevant to the linguistic signal is concentrated in one location in the visual scene.

Our key behavioral prediction is that processing serially-presented text will shift the value of allocating fixations to the center stimulus as the linguistic information unfolds in time. This shift in information value should result in listeners allocating more fixations to the center stimulus and fewer to the objects in the visual scene. This behavioral pattern should be indexed by proportion guessing and cutoff point parameters of the EWMA model. We did not have strong predictions for First Shift Accuracy, Reaction Time, or the HDDM parameter fits since the goal of the text manipulation was to modulate participants' strategic allocation of visual attention and not the accuracy/efficiency of information processing.

## Methods

### Participants

24 Stanford undergraduates participated (5 male) for course credit. All participants were monolingual, native English speakers and had normal vision.

### Stimuli

Audio and visual stimuli were identical to the Face and Bullseye tasks in Experiment 1. We included a new center fixation stimulus type: printed text. The text was displayed in a white font on a black background and was programmed such that only a single word appeared on the screen, with each word appearing for the same duration as the corresponding word in the spoken language stimuli.

### Design and procedure

The design was nearly identical to Experiment 1, with the exception of a change to a within-subjects manipulation where each participant completed all four tasks (Bullseye, Face, Text, and Text-no-audio). In the Text condition, spoken language accompanied the printed text. In the Text-no-audio condition, the spoken language stimulus was removed. Participants saw a total of 128 trials while their gaze was tracked using an SMI RED corneal-reflection eye-tracker mounted on an LCD monitor, sampling at 30 Hz. The eye-tracker was first calibrated for each participant using a 6-point calibration.

*Timecourse looking.* Panel A of Figure\ \ref{fig:text-plot} presents an overview of adults's looking to the center stimulus, target, and distracter images for each center stimulus type. Similar to children's looking behavior in Experiment 1, at target-noun onset the majority of adults were looking at the center. As the target noun unfolded, the mean proportion looking to the center decreased rapidly as participants shifted their gaze to the objects. Proportion looking to the target increased sooner and reached a higher asymptote compared to proportion looking to the distracter for all four processing contexts. 

After looking to the target image, adults did not tend to shift their gaze back to the center as shown by the relatively flat proportion looking to center curves at approximately one second after target-noun onset. The primary qualitative difference in adult's looking behavior across the different center stimulus types was a higher tendency to be looking at the center stimulus in the Face and Text conditions relative to the Bullseye condition. This was especially true for the Text-no-audio condition where adults were looking to the center at target-noun onset on 100% of the trials. A cluster-based permutation analysis confrimed that there were significant differences in looking to the center stimulus between the Text-no-audio and the Bullseye, Face, and Text conditions (all ps < .001). This pattern of behavior provides preliminary evidence that making all of the linguistic information visual changed adults' looking behavior early in the timecourse of the target noun. 

*RT.* Visual inspection of Figure\ \ref{fig:text-plot}C suggests that mean response times of first shifts were similar across the four center stimulus conditions ($M_{bull}$ = `r ms_text_rt$MAP[1]` ms, $M_{face}$ = `r ms_text_rt$MAP[2]` ms, $M_{text}$ = `r ms_text_rt$MAP[3]` ms, $M_{textNoaudio}$ = `r ms_text_rt$MAP[4]` ms). We fit a linear mixed-effects regression with the same specification as in Experiment 1, but we added by-subject intercepts and slopes for each center stimulus type to account for our within-subjects manipulation. We did not see evidence that mean RTs were different across the conditions, with the null value of zero condition differences falling within the 95% HDIs for each contrast of interest (see table TODO in the appendix for the full model output). 

*Accuracy.* Next, we modeled accuracy using a mixed-effects logistic regression with the same specifications (see Panel B of Figure\ \ref{fig:text-plot}). We found that adults' first shifts were highly accurate and performed similarly across the four conditions ($M_{bullseye}$ = `r ms_text_acc$MAP[1]`, $M_{face}$ = `r ms_text_acc$MAP[2]`, $M_{text}$ = `r ms_text_acc$MAP[3]`, $M_{textNoAudio}$ = `r ms_text_acc$MAP[4]`). In contrast to the children in Experiment 1, adults' responses were above chance level even in the Bullseye condition when the center stimulus was not salient or informative (see table TODO in the appendix for the full ouput of the accuracy model). 

Adults' accurate first shifts suggests an interesting developmental difference in the construal of the center stimulus in our task. This is speculative, but it seems plausible that adults thought the Bullseye was designed to be a valid starting point for fixating gaze while the sentence unfolded (i.e., someone put this here for a reason). As a result, if adults maintained their fixation on the center stimulus for enough time to gather sufficient linguistic singal, then they were highly accurate across all four processing conditions, which is reasonable since these were highly familiar words presented in child-directed speech. 

Visual inspection of the timecourse looking curves, however, suggests that the effect of the text manipulations occurred earlier in timecourse of decisions about visual fixation. That is, in the first 300 ms after the start of the target word adults in the Bullseye, Face, and Text conditions were already allocating fixations away from the center stimulus and to the objects. In contrast, in the Text-No-Audio condition, where adults did not have access to linguistic information via the auditory channel, all of the fixations were focused on the center stimulus location. Next, we use our model-based analyses to quantify these differences in adults' decisions about where to fixate as a function of time.

*EWMA.* For all four conditions, the control statistic crossed the upper control limit (Figure\ \ref{fig:text-model-plots}A), suggesting that adults' shifts were reliably driven by linguistic information at some point in the RT distribution. There was a graded effect of condition on the cutoff point (see the horizontal shift in the vertical dashed lines in Panel A). That is, the CS crossed the UCL earliest in the Text-no-audio condition ($M_{text-no-audio}$ = `r ms_cuts_text$MAP[4]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_cuts_text$hdi_lower[4]`, `r ms_cuts_text$hdi_upper[4]`]), followed by the Text ($M_{text}$ = `r ms_cuts_text$MAP[3]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_cuts_text$hdi_lower[3]`, `r ms_cuts_text$hdi_upper[3]`]) and Face ($M_{face}$ = `r ms_cuts_text$MAP[2]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_cuts_text$hdi_lower[2]`, `r ms_cuts_text$hdi_upper[2]`]) conditions, and finally the Bullseye condition ($M_{bullseye}$ = `r ms_cuts_text$MAP[1]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_cuts_text$hdi_lower[1]`, `r ms_cuts_text$hdi_upper[1]`]). ^[See Table TODO in the appendix for the relevant statistics for the pairwise comparisons of interest.]

We also found a graded difference in the proportion of shifts that occurred when the control statistic was below the upper control limit ($M_{bullseye}$ = `r ms_guess_text$MAP[1]`, $M_{text}$ = `r ms_guess_text$MAP[3]`, $M_{text-no-audio}$ = `r ms_guess_text$MAP[4]`, $M_{face}$ = `r ms_guess_text$MAP[2]`). Adults generated fewer language-driveneye movements in the Bullseye condition as compared to the other contexts ($\beta$ = `r ms_guess_text_contrast$MAP[1]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_guess_text_contrast$hdi_lower[1]`, `r ms_guess_text_contrast$hdi_upper[1]`]), and the highest proportion of language-driven shifts in the Text-no-audio context  ($\beta$ = `r ms_guess_text_contrast$MAP[4]`, 95% HDI [`r ms_guess_text_contrast$hdi_lower[4]`, `r ms_guess_text_contrast$hdi_upper[4]`]). These results provide evidence for our key prediction: that increasing the value of fixating on the center stimulus for accessing linguistic information reduced early gaze shifts to the rest of the visual world. This shift in gaze dynamics, in turn, resulted in adults generating fewer eye movements away from the center stimulus early in the timecourse of the target noun, leading to a higher proportion of language-driven shifts.

  rename(Parameter = param_name) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(Mean, HDI_lower, HDI_upper), round, digits = 2)
```

*HDDM.* Using the classifications generated by the EWMA, we fit an HDDM to the language-driven shifts with the same specifications as in Experiment 1. There was high overlap of the posterior distributions for the drift rate parameters (see panel C of Figure 5), suggesting that participants gathered the linguistic information with similar efficiency. We also found high overlap in the distribution of boundary separation estimates for the Bullseye, Text, and Text-no-audio conditions. We saw some evidence for a higher boundary separation in the Face condition compared to the other three center stimulus types (Face boundary = `r ms.hddm.text$Mean[2]`, HDI = [`r ms.hddm.text$HDI_lower[2]`, `r ms.hddm.text$HDI_upper[2]`]; Bullseye boundary = `r ms.hddm.text$Mean[1]`, HDI = [`r ms.hddm.text$HDI_lower[1]`, `r ms.hddm.text$HDI_upper[1]`]; Text boundary = `r ms.hddm.text$Mean[3]`, HDI = [`r ms.hddm.text$HDI_lower[3]`, `r ms.hddm.text$HDI_upper[3]`]; Text-no-audio boundary = `r ms.hddm.text$Mean[4]`, HDI = [`r ms.hddm.text$HDI_lower[4]`, `r ms.hddm.text$HDI_upper[4]`]), indicating that adults' were accumulating more information before generating before shifting gaze away from a speaker's face. Note that the higher boundary separation and drift rate parameters in this context differs from the results of the standard Accuracy and Reaction Time analyses, which found similar patterns of performance. This likely occurs because the HDDM estimates parameters by integrating information from RT distributions for both correct and incorrect responses. 

*Results summary.* These results suggest that when adults were processing serially-presented text, they were less likely to generate nonlangauge-driven shifts to the objects (EWMA results) but their efficiency of processing the linguistic signal itself did not change (Accuracy, RT, and HDDM results). Interestingly, we found a graded difference in the EWMA results between the Text and Text-no-audio conditions, with the lowest proportion of early, nonlanguage-driven shifts occurring when adults' processed text without accompanied verbal language. This behavior seems reasonable; if the adults could rely on the auditory channel to gather the linguistic information, then the value of fixating on the text display decreases. In contrast to the children in Experiment 1, adults were highly accurate in the Bullseye condition, perhaps because they construed the Bullseye as a center fixation that they *should* fixate, or perhaps they had better encoded the location/identity of the two referents prior to the start of the target sentence.

The results of Experiment 2, however, are limited in several ways. First, the text manipulation did not result in a clear difference in first shift accuracy or reaction time. We think this might be caused by ceiling effects in our paradigm since adults are so highly practiced at recognizing the familiar nouns used in the task. Second, while serially-presented text shares some features with processing a visual-manual language like ASL, it is nonetheless a very different cognitive task. Moreover, text is typically scanned by a reader and not presented word-by-word. Thus, we want to be careful to not making any claims about absolute differences in how rapidly or accurately text is processed relative to spoken language. Finally, and most importantly for our theoretical account, the text paradigm is not suitable for our target age range: young children acquiring their first language. Thus, we designed Experiment 3 to be a well-controlled test of our information seeking account that (1) used a manipulation within the domain of spoken language comprehension and (2) could be used with both adults and children.

In Experiment 3, we measured adults and children's eye movements during a real-time language comprehension task where participants processed familiar sentences (e.g., "Where's the ball?") while looking at a simplified visual world with three fixation targets. Using a within-participants design, we manipulated the signal-to-noise ratio of the auditory signal by convolving the acoustic input with brown noise (random noise with greater energy at lower frequencies).

We predicted that processing speech in a noisy context would make participants less likely to shift before collecting sufficient information. ^[See https://osf.io/g8h9r/ for a pre-registration of the analysis plan.] This delay, in turn, would lead to a lower proportion of shifts flagged as random/exploratory in the EWMA analysis, and a pattern of HDDM results indicating a prioritization of accuracy over and above speed of responding. We also predicted a developmental difference: that children would produce a higher proportion of random shifts and accumulate information less efficiently compared to adults, and a developmental parallel: that children would show the same pattern of adapting gaze patterns to gather more visual information in the noisy processing context.

## Methods

### Participants

```{r noise filter}
d_noise <- d %>% 
  filter(experiment != "kids_gaze",
         keep_runsheet %in% c("yes", "keep"), 
         keep_et == "include",
         gaze_condition == "straight_ahead")
```

```{r noise participants}
noise_adults <- d_noise %>% 
  filter(age_category == "adults") %>% 
  select(subid, gender) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  tally()

noise_kids <- d_noise %>% 
  filter(age_category == "children") %>% 
  select(subid, age, gender) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  tally()

n_adults_run <- d %>% 
  filter(age_category == "adults") %>% 
  select(subid) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  tally() %>% 
  pull(n)

n_kids_run <- d %>% 
  filter(age_category == "children", experiment == "kids_noise") %>% 
  select(subid) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  tally() %>% 
  pull(n)

n_kids_filt <- n_kids_run - sum(noise_kids$n)
n_adults_filt <- n_adults_run - sum(noise_adults$n)
```

Participants were native, monolingual English-learning children ($n=$ `r sum(noise_kids$n)`; `r noise_kids$n[1]` F) and adults ($n=$ `r sum(noise_adults$n)`; `r noise_adults$n[1]` F). All participants had no reported history of developmental or language delay and normal vision. `r n_kids_filt + n_adults_filt` participants (`r n_kids_filt` children, `r n_adults_filt` adults) were run but not included in the analysis because either the eye tracker falied to calibrate (2 children, 3 adults) or the participant did not complete the task (9 children). 

### Stimuli 

```{r linguistic stimuli length}
d_word_lengths <- d_stim %>% 
  filter(!is.na(noun)) %>% 
  select(noun, carrier, noun_onset_sec:noun_offset_frames) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("noun_")), as.numeric) %>% 
  mutate(
    length_frames =  ( (noun_offset_sec * 33) + noun_offset_frames ) - ( (noun_onset_sec * 33) + (noun_onset_frames) ),
    length_ms = length_frames * 33
  ) 

ms_words_length <- d_word_lengths %>% 
  group_by(carrier, noun) %>% 
  summarise(m_length = mean(length_ms)) %>% 
  group_by(noun) %>% 
  summarise(m = mean(m_length) %>% round(digits = 2)) 
```

*Linguistic stimuli.* The video/audio stimuli were recorded in a sound-proof room and featured two female speakers who used natural child-directed speech and said one of two phrases: "Hey! Can you find the (target word)" or "Look! Where's the (target word). The target words were: ball, bunny, boat, bottle, cookie, juice, chicken, and shoe. The target words varied in length (shortest = `r min(ms_words_length$m)` ms, longest = `r max(ms_words_length$m)` ms) with an average length of `r mean(ms_words_length$m) %>% round(digits=2)` ms. 

*Noise manipulation*. To create the stimuli in the noise condition, we convolved each recording with Brown noise using the Audacity audio editor. The average signal-to-noise ratio (values greater than 0 dB indicate more signal than noise) in the noise condition was 2.87 dB compared to the clear condition, which was 35.05 dB. 

*Visual stimuli.* The image set consisted of colorful digitized pictures of objects presented in fixed pairs with no phonological overlap between the target and the distracter image (cookie-bottle, boat-juice, bunny-chicken, shoe-ball). The side of the target picture was counterbalanced across trials.

### Design and procedure

Participants viewed the task on a screen while their gaze was tracked using an SMI RED corneal-reflection eye-tracker mounted on an LCD monitor, sampling at 30 Hz. The eye-tracker was first calibrated for each participant using a 6-point calibration. On each trial, participants saw two images of familiar objects on the screen for two seconds before the center stimulus appeared. Next, they processed the target sentence -- which consisted of a carrier phrase, a target noun, and a question -- followed by two seconds without language to allow for a response. Child participants saw 32 trials (16 noise trials; 16 clear trials) with several filler trials interspersed to maintain interest. Adult participants saw 64 trials (32 noise; 32 clear). The noise manipulation was presented in a blocked design with the order of block counterbalanced across participants.

### Behavioral analyses

*Timecourse looking.* Figure\ \ref{fig:noise-acc-rt-plot}A presents an overview of looking to the speaker, target, and distracter images for the noisy and clear processing contexts from the start of the target noun. Similar to the results in Experiment 1 and 2, participants tended to fixate on the speaker at target-noun onset. As the target noun unfolded, the mean proportion looking to the center decreased rapidly as participants shifted their gaze to the objects. Proportion looking to the target increased sooner and reached a higher asymptote compared to proportion looking to the distracter for all four processing contexts. After looking to the target image, participants tended to shift their gaze back to the speaker as shown by the increase in center looking curve around 1 second. 

There are several developmental differences to highlight. First, children tended to look more to the objects at noun onset, as indicated by the lower intercept of children's center-looking curves. Second, children's target looking curves reached a lower asymptote as compared to adults and they spent relatively more time fixating on the distracter image, whereas adults rarely looked at the unnamed object after 0.5 seconds in the timecourse of the trial. And third, children showed a stronger tendency to shift back to the speaker after looking to the named object.

Visual inspection of the center looking curve suggests a key conditon difference in looking behavior for the noisy processing context. That is, both children and adult's spent more time fixating on the speaker when the auditory signal was less reliable as indicated by the shift to the right in the center-looking curves for the noisy context. A cluster-based permutation test confirmed that there was evidence of a significant difference in looking to the speaker between the Noisy and Clear conditions ($p < .05$). This pattern of behavior provides preliminary evidence that reducing the quality of the auditory signal increased looking to the speaker early in the timecourse of the target noun.

*RT.* Figure\ \ref{fig:noise-acc-rt-plot}A shows the full distribution of the estimated RT differences between each participants' performance in the noise and clear contexts. Both children and adults were slower to identify the target in the noise condition (Children $M_{noise}$ = `r ms_rt_noise$m_rt[4]` ms; Adult $M_{noise}$ = `r ms_rt_noise$m_rt[3]` ms), as compared to the clear condition (Children $M_{clear}$ = `r ms_rt_noise$m_rt[2]` ms Adult $M_{clear}$ = `r ms_rt_noise$m_rt[1]` ms). RTs in the noise condition were `r ms_noise_con_rt$m_rt[1]` ms slower on average, with a 95% HDI ranging from `r ms_noise_con_rt$hdi_lower[1]` ms to `r ms_noise_con_rt$hdi_upper[1]` ms, and not including the null value of zero condition difference. Older children responded faster than younger children ($\beta_{age}$ = `r ms_noise_age_rt$m_rt`, [`r ms_noise_age_rt$hdi_lower`, `r ms_noise_age_rt$hdi_upper`]), with little evidence for an interaction between age and condition. 

*Accuracy.* Next, we modeled adults and children's first shift accuracy using a mixed-effects logistic regression with the same specifications (Figure\ \ref{fig:noise-acc-rt-plot}B). Both groups were more accurate than a model of random responding (null value of $0.5$ falling well outside the lower bound of the 95% HDI for all group means). Adults were more accurate ($M_{adults} =$ `r ms_acc_noise$prop[1] * 100`%) than children ($M_{children} =$ `r ms_acc_noise$prop[2] * 100`%). The key result is that both groups showed evidence of higher accuracy in the noise condition: children ($M_{noise}$ = `r ms_acc_noise$prop[4]* 100`%; $M_{clear}$ = `r ms_acc_noise$prop[2]* 100`%) and adults ($M_{noise}$ = `r ms_acc_noise$prop[3]* 100`%; $M_{clear}$ = `r ms_acc_noise$prop[1]* 100`%). Accuracy in the noise condition was on average `r ms_noise_con_acc$m_acc[1] * 100`%  higher, with a 95% HDI from `r ms_noise_con_acc$hdi_lower[1]* 100`% to `r ms_noise_con_acc$hdi_upper[1] * 100`%. Note that the null value of zero difference falls at the very edge of the HDI. But `r prob_diff0$prob[1] * 100`% of the credible values are greater than zero, providing evidence for higher accuracy in the noise condition. Within the child sample, there was no evidence of a main effect of age or an interaction between age and noise condition.

### Model-based analyses

**EWMA.** Figure\ \ref{fig:noise-model-plots}A shows the proportion of shifts that the model classified as random vs. language-driven for each age group and processing context. On average, `r ms_guess_noise_age$MAP[2] * 100`% (95% HDI: `r ms_guess_noise_age$hdi_lower[2] * 100`%, `r ms_guess_noise_age$hdi_upper[2] * 100`%) of children's shifts were categorized as language-driven, which was significantly fewer than adults, `r ms_guess_noise_age$MAP[1] * 100`% (95% HDI: `r ms_guess_noise_age$hdi_lower[1] * 100`%, `r ms_guess_noise_age$hdi_upper[1] * 100`%). Critically, processing speech in a noisy context caused both adults and children to generate a higher proportion of language-driven shifts (i.e., fewer random, exploratory shifts away from the speaker), with the 95% HDI excluding the null value of zero condition difference ($\beta_{noise}$ = `r ms_cond_diff_guessing_m$MAP[2] * 100`%, [`r ms_cond_diff_guessing_m$hdi_lower[2] * 100`%, `r ms_cond_diff_guessing_m$hdi_upper[2] * 100`%]). Within the child sample, older children generated fewer random, early shifts ($M_{age}$ = `r ms_ewma_age_kids$MAP`, [`r ms_ewma_age_kids$hdi_lower`, `r ms_ewma_age_kids$hdi_upper`]). There was no eivdence of an interaction between age and condition. This pattern of results suggests that the noise condition caused participants to increase visual fixations to the language source, leading them to generate fewer exploratory, random shifts before accumulating sufficient information to respond accurately.

**HDDM.** Figure\ \ref{fig:noise-model-plots}B shows the full posterior distributions for the HDDM output. Children had lower drift rates (children $M_{drift}$ = `r hddm_table_age$MAP[4]`; adults $M_{drift}$ = `r hddm_table_age$MAP[3]`) and boundary separation estimates (children $M_{boundary}$ = `r hddm_table_age$MAP[2]`; adults $M_{boundary}$ = `r hddm_table_age$MAP[1]`) as compared to adults, suggesting that children were less efficient and less cautious in their responding. The noise manipulation selectively affected the boundary separation parameter, with higher estimates in the noise condition for both age groups ($\beta_{noise}$ = `r hddm_table_contrast$MAP[1]`, [`r hddm_table_contrast$HDI_lower[1]`, `r hddm_table_contrast$HDI_upper[1]`]). This result suggests that participants' in the noise condition prioritized information accumulation over speed when generating an eye movement in response to the incoming language. This increased decision threshold led to higher accuracy. Moreover, the high overlap in estimates of drift rate suggests that participants were able to integrate the visual and auditory signals such that they could achieve a level of processing efficiency comparable to the clear processing context.

Taken together, the behavioral and EWMA/HDDM results provide key confirmatory evidence for the predictions of our information-seeking account. Processing speech in noise caused listeners to seek additional visual information to support language comprehension. Moreover, we observed a very similar pattern of behavior in children and adults, with both groups producing more language-driven shifts and prioritizing accuracy over speed in the more challenging noisy environment. 

# General Discussion

Language comprehension in grounded, social contexts provides children access to a rich set of multimodal cues that could support linking linguistic information to the world. But how do children select what visual information to gather? In this work, we proposed that listeners flexibly adapt their gaze to seek visual information from their social partners when it was especially useful for language comprehension. We presented evidence for our account by measuring changes in how children chose to allocate visual attention across a diverse set of language processing contexts. In Experiment 1, we found that, compared to children learning spoken English, young ASL-learners delayed their gaze shifts away from a language source, were more accurate, and produced a smaller proportion of nonlanguage-driven eye movements. In Experiment 2, we found that English-speaking adults produced fewer nonlanguage-driven gaze shifts when processing serially-presented text as compared to spoken language. Finally, in Experiment 3, we showed that 3-5 year-olds and adults delayed the timing of gaze shifts away from a speaker's face while processing speech in a noisy environment. This slower response resulted in fewer nonlanguage-driven eye movements and more accurate gaze shifts. Together, these results provide evidence that young listeners adapt their gaze patterns to the demands of different processing environments by seeking out visual information from social partners to support language comprehension.

These results synthesize ideas from several research programs, including work on language-mediated visual attention [@tanenhaus1995integration], goal-based accounts of vision during everyday tasks [@hayhoe2005eye], and work on  Language perception as multisensory integration  @vigliocco2014language]. Moreover, our findings parallel the results of several recent studies that measure the adaption of cognitive processes in response to different environmental inputs. First, @heimler2015finding compared Deaf and hearing adults' performance on an oculomotor additional singleton paradigm where participants made speeded eye-movements to a unique orientation target embedded among distracters that varied in saliency. Deaf adults were slower to generate a gaze shift away from the center fixation and, as a result, they were less affected by high saliency distracter objects. Second, recent work by @mcmurray2017waiting found that individuals with Cochlear Implants, who are consistently processing degraded auditory input, are more likely to delay the process of lexical access as measured by slower gaze shifts to named referents and fewer incorrect gaze shifts to phonological onset competitors. @mcmurray2017waiting also found that they could replicate these changes to gaze patterns in adults with typical hearing by degrading the auditory stimuli so that it shared features with the output of a cochlear implant (noise-vocoded speech).

Our findings also contribute to the literature investigating how experience with a visual-manual language may change basic cognitive processes (see @bavelier2006deaf for a review). The upshot of this work is that the effects of Deafness can be dissociated from the effects of learning a signed language. Specifically, Deaf individuals show selective enhancement in peripheral visual attention as evidenced by higher sensitivity to peripheral distracters on spatial orienting tasks. In contrast, learning to sign results in several specific changes such as enhanced mental imagery [@emmorey1993visual], mental rotation [@emmorey1998mental], and face processing [@bettger1997enhanced]. Our results suggest that ASL learners adapt the timing of when they disengage from a language source to increase their certainty before seeking named object. It is an open question as to whether ASL-learners' differential responding is best explained by lack of access to auditory information or learning a visual-manual language.

Finally, our results dovetail with recent developmental work by @yurovsky2017preschoolers. In their study, preschoolers, like adults, were able to integrate top-down expectations about the kinds of things speakers are likely to talk about with bottom-up cues from auditory perception. @yurovsky2017preschoolers situated this finding within the framework of modeling language as a *noisy channel* where listeners combine expectations with perceptual data and weight each based on its reliability. In Experiment 3, we found a similar developmental parallel in language processing: that 3-5 year-olds, like adults, adapted their gaze patterns to seek additional visual information when the auditory signal became less reliable. This adaptation allowed listeners to generate comparable, if not more, accurate responses in the noisy context. 

In sum, the work reported here shows that listeners will seek visual information to integrate with the linguistic signal to support language comprehension. These results dovetail with the models of language processing reviewed earlier, suggesting that language perception is highly interactive and draws on information from multiple modalities [@mcclelland2006there; @macdonald2006constraint]. These results also show the value of studying language comprehension across a wider variety of contexts than those typically studied in developmental psycholinguistics, highlighting the point that models of language comprehension should consider active processes of  gathering information from social partners during face-to-face communication.

## Limitations and future work

This work has several important limitations that pave the way for future work. First, we chose to focus on a single decision about visual fixation to provide a window onto the dynamics of decision-making across different language processing contexts. But our analysis does not consider the rich information present in the gaze patterns that occur leading up to this decision. In our future work, we aim to measure how changes in the language environment might lead to shifts in the dynamics of gaze across a longer timescale. For example, perhaps listeners gather more information about the objects in the scene before the sentence in anticipation of allocating more attention to the speaker once they start to speak. 

Second, we chose one instantiation of a noisy processing context -- random background noise. But we think our findings should generalize to contexts where other kinds of noise -- e.g., uncertainty over a speaker's reliability or when processing accented speech -- make gathering visual information from the speaker more useful for language understanding. Moreover, we used a simple visual world, with only three places to look, and simple linguistic stimuli, especially for the adults in Experiments 2 and 3. Thus it remains an open question how these results might scale up to more complex language interactions and visual environments. It could be that looks to a speaker become even more useful for disambiguating reference in complex visual environments. 

Third, we do not yet know what might be driving the population differences between children learning ASL and children learning spoken English found in Experiment 1. It could be that ASL-learners' massive experience dealing with competition for visual attention leads to changes in the deployment of eye movements during language comprehension. Or, it could be that the in-the-moment constraints of processing a visual language cause different fixation behaviors. This question could be addressed by studies that measure how quickly listeners adapt the dynamics of gaze when visual information becomes more useful. Another interesting approach would be to measure eye movements in hearing children learning both a signed and a spoken language (bimodal bilinguals). This comparison between native hearing and deaf signers would allow for a dissociation of the effects of learning a visual-manual language from the effects of lacking access to auditory information (e.g., @bavelier2006deaf). If hearing signers also prioritize accuracy over speed when processing their spoken language, this would suggest that experience with a visual-manual language is changing a general response strategy. 

Finally, our eye tracking paradigm removes an important component of successful communication: dynamic interaction between the speaker and listener. It is interesting to consider how speakers might adapt their behavior present the listener with useful visual information in challenging comprehension contexts. For example, in noisy environments, speakers will exaggerate mouth movements [@fitzpatrick2011effect] and increase the frequency of gestural cues such as head nodding [@munhall2004visual], and parents exaggerate mouth movements during infant-directed speech [@green2010lip]. Moreover, observational studies of parent-child interactions in signed languages show variability in how sensitive adult signers are to the competing demands on children's visual attention [@harris1997learning]. That is, some interactions contain many utterances that young signers miss because they are fixating on objects; whereas other interactions are marked by adaptations that accommodate the demands on visual attention by parents displacing signs onto the objects that are currently the focus of children's attention (similar to follow-in labeling effects @tomasello1986joint). Thus it is an interesting, open question how interacting with a speaker that adapts to increase the availability and utility of visual information might change children's decisions about visual fixation.  

## Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed an information-seeking account of eye movements within the domain of grounded language comprehension. We started from an interesting, observational result: that ASL learners, compared to English-learning children, generate slower but more accurate gaze shifts away from a language source and to a named referent. We then tested the generality and causal claims of our account by experimentally manipulating the value of visual information for language comprehension. We found that even young listeners adapt the dynamics of their gaze to gather visual information when it is useful for language understanding. 

While we chose to start with the domain of familiar language processing, we think the account is more general and could could be applied to the language acquisition context. Consider that early in language learning, children are acquiring novel word-object links while also learning about visual object categories. Both of these tasks produce different goals that should, in turn, modulate children's decisions about where to allocate visual attention -- e.g., seeking nonlinguistic cues to reference such as eye gaze and pointing become critical when you are unfamiliar with the information in the linguistic signal. Our future work is aimed at pursuing these question. More generally, this framework presents a way forward for explaining links between decisions about visual fixation, language comprehension, and acquisition across a wider set of processing contexts and at different stages of development.
